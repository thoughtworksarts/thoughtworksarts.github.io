<h2 id=rashin-fahandej-award-of-distinction>Rashin Fahandej Award of Distinction</h2>
<p>Former volumetric filmmaking resident Rashin Fahandej was awarded the <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/rashin-fahandej-award-of-distinction-ars-electronica/">Prix Ars Electronica Award of Distinction in Digital Music and Sound Art for A Father’s Lullaby</a>. The project was incubated as part of Rashin’s residency at Thoughtworks Arts.</p>

<p><a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/a-fathers-lullaby/">A Father’s Lullaby</a> is a multi-platform, community engaged interactive work that highlights the role of men in raising children and their absence due to the racial disparities in the criminal justice system with its direct impact on children, women and lower income communities.</p>

<h2 id=climateactiontech-award-for-digital-humanity>ClimateAction.tech Award for Digital Humanity</h2>
<p><a href="https://climateaction.tech/">ClimateAction.tech</a> is an international community initiative with thousands of members in the tech sector focused on the climate crisis, co-founded in 2017 by Thoughtworks Arts Director Andrew McWilliams and co-organized through 2020. ClimateAction.tech was awarded the <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/climate-action-tech-ars-electronica-award-digital-humanity/">Prix Ars Electronica Award for Digital Humanity for creating <em>Branch</em> - an online ‘Sustainable Internet For All’ magazine</a>.</p>

<p>The magazine was spearheaded by Michelle Thorne, Chris Adams, Laurence Bascle, Carrie Hou, Tom Jarrett, Jack Lenox, Hannah Smith and others as part of an international community effort.</p>

<p>Branch’s design renders its display output according to energy grid intensity depending on where the reader is accessing the site. The user interface of the magazine, designed by <a href="https://tomjarrett.earth/">Tom Jarrett</a>, was to be ‘Demand Responsive’, meaning it adapts to the physical infrastructure of the internet and the energy behind the page view.</p>

<p>In the interview, Adrianne shares how she found her voice as a groundbreaking pioneer in robotic art, and the kind of obstacles she experienced as a woman working in robotics and communicating between art and science.</p>

<p>Adrianne discussed her fascination with sentience when juxtaposed against machines, and her pull to explore humanity through robotics. This passion carried over into her Thoughtworks Arts residency project, <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/sentient-thespian/">The Sentient Thespian</a>, a film exploring attributions of sentience to robots, by humans, as a feature of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.</p>

<p>The podcast episode also highlights her new book project, <a href="http://www.adriannewortzel.com/projects/see-no-evil/">See No Evil</a>.</p>
