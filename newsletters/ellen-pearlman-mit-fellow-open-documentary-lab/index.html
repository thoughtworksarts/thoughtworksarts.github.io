<p>Participants were put into three interdisciplinary teams to collaborate on prototyping a synthetic media project. Teams explored the possibilities of artificially generated media and investigated artistic ways in which to apply these innovative findings. Their work was also driven by questions about the societal impacts of this rapidly growing field.</p>

<p>The masterclass concluded in final team presentations of their synthetic media projects, sharing what they learned to develop future projects on a larger scale.</p>
