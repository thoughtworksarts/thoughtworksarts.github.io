<p><em><a href="/blog/dilate-ensemble-presents-catena-counterpulse/">CATENA</a></em>, a non-looping visual and densely textured sound environment allows performers and audience members to experience livestreams from two different physical locations inside CounterPulse’s Tenderloin District building, located in San Francisco.<!--excerpt-ends--> Due to the Covid pandemic, music and movement performances also occurred remotely and were seamlessly mixed live time. <em>CATENA</em> explored what the imprint of a physical space, and the bodies within it can be.</p>

<p>Dilate Ensemble built a customized network throughout the course of their 16-week residency. The network linked different sound environments within the CounterPulse building by sending their audio feeds for processing to electronic musician Scott Miller, remotely based in Minnesota. Sonic variables like amplitude, frequency, physical characteristics of the room, speaker placement, and microphones impacted simple behaviors producing complex layered outcomes. CounterPulse’s upstairs studio, as well as the dedicated project space in the basement were animated by the audio-reactive video projection installations of artist Carole Kim. For this event Dilate Ensemble was also joined by special guest, dancer and choreographer Shinichi Iova-Koga.</p>

<p>As part of their 16-week residency begun in the fall of 2021, h0tclub is developing performing robots who respond to numerous sensors and cameras placed throughout CounterPulse’s project space, communicating with one another via a wireless network.  This hybrid virtual/physical network of human and non-human agents is influenced and guided by the emergent behaviors of the system’s inhabitants.</p>

<p>Thursday, March 10th’s virtual showing features a work-in-progress of the three performers and three robots throughout a 25 minute experience. The livestream lets audiences from the comfort of their homes use the chat function to control the performers and robots in real-time. <a href=https://counterpulse.secure.force.com/ticket/#/events/a0S4y00000DjaxFEAR>RSVP now to secure your place</a>.</p>

<p>Join the livestream via <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/counterpulsesf>the CounterPulse Twitch channel</a>.</p>

<p>h0t club will also have a world premiere of their piece on May 7th as part of the CounterPulse Gala. Stay tuned for updates.</p>

<h2 id=forbes-how-thoughtworks-arts-drives-innovation>Forbes: How Thoughtworks Arts Drives Innovation</h2>

<p>Forbes published the article <a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminwolff/2022/01/14/what-is-the-value-of-an-artist-for-tech-consultancy-thoughtworks-its-a-lot>What Is The Value Of An Artist? For Tech Consultancy Thoughtworks — It’s A Lot</a>, by Benjamin Wolff. The article spotlights Thoughtworks Arts in detail, describing how we incubate art and technology innovation and how this empowers both technologists and artists.</p>

<p>Featured was Synthetic Media resident Nouf Aljowaysir’s project <em>Salaf</em>, illustrating how developers at Thoughtworks helped her explore bias in AI and neural networks through the lens of her Saudi ancestry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I was trying to create my own nuanced data set. And I said to him, ‘I don’t know about that.’ But then I thought, ‘Okay, why not? Let’s try it.’ And so we tried it out and we found a lot of bias. For example, it didn’t recognize a hijab, and got all the features wrong. Or it would just show a lot of bias towards Western faces. That was a key moment.” - Nouf Aljowaysir</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our co-directors Andrew McWilliams and Ellen Pearlman explained how incubation between artists and technologists pushes boundaries and creates work that drives critical questions.</p>

<p>A core element behind our successful incubations is Thoughtworkers, now more than 10,000 employees in 48 offices across 17 countries. Thoughtworkers are embedded in Thoughtworks Arts project incubations throughout our global operations, working with international partners to bring artists’ visions to life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When you bring these groups of people together from different backgrounds it provides a richer experience for the artists. That’s one of the things they’ll often comment on. They’ve never worked with such an international group.” - Andrew McWilliams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thoughtworks CEO Chris Murphy shared his view that incubating artists helps drive innovation and is a powerful part of Thoughtworks’ forward-looking culture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When you see breakthrough innovation, it tends to happen on the edge of things, on the edge of chaos,” said Murphy. “And that’s because it involves rethinking how something is looked at or perceived or thought about from an entirely new perspective.”</p>

  <p>“Thoughtworks Arts brings together technologist and artist at the intersection of sociological challenges. It says, ‘What might happen if we apply this technological innovation to this pressing social challenge—and connect this artist, who comes from a very different background, with this set of technologists?” - Chris Murphy</p>
</blockquote>
