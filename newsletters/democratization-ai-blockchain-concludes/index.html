<p>The three artists, who collectively work across an array of media, developed the distributed storytelling project <em>All Possible Pathways</em> based on remote collaboration using blockchain technology.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>The team wrapped up with an internal presentation to Thoughtworks employees, and a public write-up of their project will appear on our website shortly.</p>

<h2 id=ellen-pearlman-presents-at-us-fulbright-alumni-exchange-seminar>Ellen Pearlman Presents at U.S. Fulbright Alumni Exchange Seminar</h2>
<p>In December, director Ellen Pearlman presented in Santa Fe as a <a href="https://fulbrightspecialist.worldlearning.org/the-fulbright-specialist-program/">Fulbright World Learning Specialist</a> at <a href=https://alumni.state.gov/alumni-news/alumni-thematic-international-exchange-seminars-alumni-ties>The US Fulbright Alumni Exchange Seminar</a>. The four-day event brought Fulbright alumni whose work speaks to the issue “Art, Culture, and Transforming Conflict”.</p>

</figure>

<p>Ellen presented “Advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Arts”, highlighting Thoughtworks Arts programs that have promoted social change through their artistic and technology incubations.</p>

<p>The convening also focused on how to address local issues through the development of arts programming and networks of change. The Alumni group collaborated on future community-based projects for which the U.S. State Department will provide grants.</p>

<p>Our blog post explains more about <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/ellen-pearlman-us-fulbright-alumni-exchange/">AlumniTIES and all that Ellen has been instrumental in.</a></p>

<h2 id=recap-a-look-back-at-2019>Recap: A Look Back at 2019</h2>
<p>Thank you to everyone in our expansive community who collaborated, partnered, and helped move our many projects forward with support and insight - making 2019 a hugely successful year for Thoughtworks Arts.</p>

<p>We couldn’t have predicted the reach so many of these important collaborations between artists, technologists, and our team would have, nor how developments would play out both publicly and within Thoughtworks. This feedback guides and inspires our vision moving forward.</p>

<p>And now, some highlights from this past year:</p>
