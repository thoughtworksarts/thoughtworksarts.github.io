        <p>Artist and engineer Joaquin Fargas is at the midpoint of his Thoughtworks Arts Residency at Mars College in the Southern California desert. He traveled from his home in Argentina in early January to work on robotics and sustainability <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CoMA7GwMDjK/">in harsh environments</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>Joaquin began his residency aiding with the construction of the temporary building housing the nomadic Mars community. The team constructed a wall of solar panels to help power the structure, which will only be in use during the first three months of the year due to the intense desert heat and will be disassembled afterwards.</p>

<p>Next, Joaquin <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CoG3VvFLG5m/">built a lab in the desert</a> from which to work and ideate about his 2023 project. He is focusing on multipe projects including a water-traversing spider robot that scans for specific environmental sensor readings in the Salton Sea.</p>

<p>To aid his development of the spider robot Joaquin is collaborating remotely with Thoughtworkers in Pune and Chennai, including <a href=https://in.linkedin.com/in/amit-patel-0952a216>Amit Patel</a>, <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/harishkumarbalaji/">Harish Kumar Balaji</a>, <a href=https://in.linkedin.com/in/atul-chaudhari-0202b2a1>Atul Chaudhari</a> and <a href=https://in.linkedin.com/in/ketan-sangle-21b25b176>Ketan Sangle</a>.</p>

<p>Core to Mars College’s mission is the participants practice the art of self-reliance, living a hybrid off-grid existence in a difficult desert environment while co-collaboratiing. We are excited to partner with <a href="https://mars.college/">Mars.College</a> to support Fargas in developing his projects on eco-technology, sustainability and robotics.</p>

<h2 id=smithsonian-presents-world-premiere-of-catie-cuans-in-her-prime>Smithsonian Presents World Premiere of Catie Cuan’s ‘In Her Prime’</h2>

<p>The first human-robot performance in the history of the Smithsonian Institute was created as part  of <a href="https://aib.si.edu/futuristinresidence/">Catie Cuan’s Futurist-in-Residence at the Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>‘In Her Prime’ had it’s world premiere inside the Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building on July 6th, 2022. The presentation featured three human dancers and <a href=https://www.bostondynamics.com/products/spot>two Boston Dynamics “Spot” robots</a> as well as original music, choreography, and video.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was inspired by the vast history of humans and our tools and how the objects and environments we create demand our submission. This choreorobotics dance is part atavistic ceremony, part celestial conjuring, and part ecstatic romping.<br><span class=quotee>— Catie Cuan</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>During Cuan’s residency at Thoughtworks Arts she explored the importance of movement in robots, especially as they become more ubiquitous and incorporated into our everyday existence.  The work developed out of her <a href="/projects/liminal/">‘liminal’</a> project that captured the power of nuanced and transitional movements between a human and a 16-foot industrial robot.</p>
