<p>Due to COVID-19, James and Nouf will both work remotely on projects from their respective studios in Seattle and Brooklyn.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<h2 id=nouf-aljowaysir>Nouf Aljowaysir</h2>
<p>Nouf, a <a href="http://www.noufaljowaysir.com/">Saudi-born, New York-based artist</a>, whose work focuses on creative coding has utilized <a href=http://www.noufaljowaysir.com/adp>machine learning style transfer</a> techniques to critique the complex interweaving of <a href=http://www.noufaljowaysir.com/alexa-call-mom>perceptions and perception management of voice conversational technologies</a>. She will develop her project at Thoughtworks Arts which emulates the cultural transmission of ideas and worldviews across human generations.</p>

</figure>

<p>Nouf will process elements of cultural artifacts from her personal history and research, transforming them into machine learning systems through data chains.</p>

<h2 id=james-coupe>James Coupe</h2>
<p>James Coupe, a <a href="http://jamescoupe.com/">British artist based in Seattle</a> works with video, installation, internet, and emerging media forms. He will investigate historical archives in order to expose lineages of social and economic divisions in the UK during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Simultaneously, he will highlight the parallel trajectories throughout the world that were occurring under the scope of British colonialism.</p>

<p>Technically this includes working with generative adversarial networks such as StyleGAN, ATTNGan and others, and potentially using generative linguistic modeling such as GPT-2 and GPT-3. These will be rolled together into architectural plans for a Brexit-inspired theme park potentially using <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/archigan-generative-stack-apartment-building-design/">ArchiGAN</a>.</p>

<p>We look forward to assisting both Nouf and James on developing their respective projects and having them join  our Thoughtworks Arts community. You can <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/welcoming-new-residents-synthetic-media/">learn more about them and their work in our latest blog</a>.</p>

<p>Our external partners for this residency are <a href="http://opendoclab.mit.edu/">MIT Open Doc Lab</a>, an academic center for innovative documentary research, and <a href="https://lab.witness.org/">WITNESS</a>, a non-profit organization dealing with human rights and emerging technologies.</p>

<h2 id=ellen-pearlman-leads-first-ever-remote-exchange-program-with-aai---ukraine>Ellen Pearlman Leads first-ever Remote Exchange Program with AAI - Ukraine</h2>
<p>Ellen Pearlman was the lead American artist for the <a href="https://zero1.org/">Zero1</a>, <a href="https://americanartsincubator.org/exchange/ukraine-2/">American Arts Incubator - Ukraine</a> exchange program hosted by <a href="https://izolyatsia.org/en/">Izolytsia - Platform For Cultural Initiatives</a> in Kyiv, and the <a href="https://ua.usembassy.gov/">US Embassy in Ukraine</a>. The month-long exchange program was reimagined and restructured as a remote, bilingual collaboration across timezones after Covid-19 spread across the globe.</p>

<p>Ellen led twenty-four artists scattered throughout Ukraine in a virtual incubator program involving a series of workshops that explored art and artificial intelligence. Participants created four prototypes that investigated the experience of isolation and connectedness; environmental degradation and moral responsibility; conspirology; and Mudra a machine learning implementation of sign language for hearing impaired Ukrainians.</p>

<p>The exchange concluded with a virtual presentation of participants’ work on May 14th and included an extensive Q&amp;A with special guests from the art and technology community.</p>

<p>The American Arts Incubator program pivots on a global network based on these kinds of exchanges - between American artists and international participants. Support and funding are received from US Embassies, as well as artistic, cultural and educational organizations. This network aims to show how foreign partnerships and creative participation drive dialogue on pressing social problems. The exchange promotes intercultural understanding through art to help build and support communities.</p>

<p>We will be working with two incredible dancers from Battery Dance Company, Hussein Smko, and Razvan Stoian. During the performances, they will be wearing Emotibits, special wearable sensors that transmit biometric data in real-time. The dancers will perform in separate studio spaces while Art-A-Hackers create with them over a network in virtual spaces, or in ways yet to be imagined.</p>
