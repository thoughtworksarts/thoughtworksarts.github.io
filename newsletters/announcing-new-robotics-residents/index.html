<p><a href="http://www.adriannewortzel.com/">Adrianne Wortzel</a> is an acclaimed artist who creates unique and innovative interactive web-based works, robotic and telerobotic installations, performance productions, videos, and writings. During her residency at ThoughtWorks Arts, Adrianne will be initiating a project to develop a social and psychotherapeutic tool for nonverbal expression through gesture.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p><a href="http://catiecuan.com/">Catie Cuan</a> is a performer, choreographer, and technologist. Her current robotics work, <em>Time to Compile</em>, shows how choreography can inform the design of robots to make them more effective and expressive, especially for personal spaces like homes and hospitals. Catie will use her residency to finalize the performance piece and synthesize her research for this project.</p>

<p>The residency was awarded to these two artists respectively, because of their unique and complementary views on important issues. Their practices provide different critical approaches to issues of the mechanical and movement, as it pertains to robotics and human-computer interaction.</p>

<p>You can learn more about Adrianne and Catie and the projects they will be pursuing through their residency at ThoughtWorks in the <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/adrianne-wortzel-catie-cuan-awarded-robotics-residency/">announcement blog post</a>.</p>

<h2 id=updates-from-art-a-hack-alumni>Updates from Art-A-Hack™ Alumni</h2>

<p>Emmy-winning filmmaker <strong>Lisa Russell</strong> has launched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IrkBWyL3Q">#Create2030</a>, and new film and creative campaign to engage artists and storytellers in helping to meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), otherwise known as the Global Goals. Funded by the UN Secretary General’s SDG Advocacy Group, the five minute film features other conscious artists from around the world.</p>

<p>During major social holidays (such as International Women’s Day, World AIDS Day, Earth Day, etc), the campaign will be “activated” and artists will be encouraged to share their SDG-inspired creative content with the hashtag #Create2030. This allows UN/NGO agencies and other partners working on the SDGs to identify possible creative partners.</p>
