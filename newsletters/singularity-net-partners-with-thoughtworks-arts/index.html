        <p>We are thrilled to be joining forces with the world’s first decentralized AI platform, <a href=https://singularitynet.io>SingularityNET</a>, for our next residency: <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2019-democratization-ai-blockchain/">The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence via Blockchain</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchains and AI are revolutionary technologies that will imminently change how humans and industry exist forever.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>Currently the two are somewhat separate, except in niche crypto currency applications. But SingularityNET’s CEO, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJrtpwgQozw&amp;amp=&amp;feature=youtu.be">Dr. Ben Goertze</a>l, sees their widespread combined potential and set out to create a system that not only captures the power of AI, but one that also is open to absolutely everyone, ensuring that AI is transparent and decentralized.</p>

<p>It was this idea of individuals having better access and insight to AI development that became the inspiration of our residency’s key theme. We’re so excited to now have SingularityNet on board. and look forward to exploring creative approaches to the implementation of a decentralized AI through a unique art work for this upcoming residency.</p>

<p>This open call is also in collaboration with our other partner <a href="https://snark.art/">Snark.Art</a>, a developer of blockchain for art.</p>

<p>Our open call for The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence via Blockchain is still open and ends on July 31st. The residency will take place  September 30th, 2019 — January 31, 2020.</p>

<p>Past robotics resident Adrianne Wortzel’s film project, The Sentient Thespian will be screening at the <a href="http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/">Anthology Film Archives</a> through programming organized by NewFilmmakers.</p>

<p>The film was shot on location at the <a href="https://consortiumrr.com/">Consortium for Research &amp; Robotics</a>, hosted by the Pratt Institute in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Her film features their 16ft tall industrial robotic arm. It also features a non-humanoid robot called <a href="https://mekamon.com/">MekaMon</a>, manufactured by <a href="https://reachrobotics.com/">Reach Robotics</a> in the UK, and explores a narrative on technological transformations and humanity as we advance into the 4th industrial revolution. Elements of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” also swirl into the film’s theme, adding a poignant juxtaposition.</p>

<p>Adrianne Wortzel is an artist whose works include tele-robotic/robotic performance productions, interactive installations, photography, videos, art objects and writings. Her works display the arc of human experience of technological advances as they emerge, become pervasive, and eventually obsolete.</p>

<p>You can learn more about Adrianne and her project on <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/adrianne-wortzel/">her resident page</a>, and <a href=https://vimeo.com/329474208>watch a teaser of the film on Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Her screening of The Sentient Thespian will start at 7:15 on Wednesday, July 17th. There will be a reception starting at 5:30. Address: 32 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003. Tickets available at the door.</p>

<p><strong>Moon Ribas</strong> recently had her seismic sensors removed from her feet. After seven years of sensing earthquakes as a cyborg, she’s now learning how to adjust to life without seismic activity registering in her physiology. However, Moon has reported to be experiencing phantom movements, confusing her nervous system.</p>

<p>“I’ve started to experience how it feels to lack a cybernetic sense and I’m now feeling phantom earthquakes. How long will these last? Will the extraction of the cybernetic organ affect my identity? Am I a phantom cyborg now? “ - Moon Ribas</p>

<p>Moon is curious to see how this transition plays out, while looking forward to experiencing movement through new forms in the future.</p>
