<h2 id=joaquín-fargas-speculative-futures>Joaquín Fargas: “Speculative Futures”</h2>

<p>The first award will support Latin American based Joaquín Fargas under the “Speculative Futures” track, designed to empower urban communities through research done in the desert.</p>

<p>As an artist and industrial engineer, Fargas integrates biological materials and technological media centered on possible or utopian proposals related to life, its preservation and the interrelationship between living beings and the future.</p>

<p>For the last 20 years Fargas has worked at the crossroads of art, science and technology, creating work including site specific installations, performances and technologically-sound speculative works which examine an era of climate crisis.</p>

		<figcaption>The Rabdomante</figcaption>
	
</figure>

<p>In his Rabdomante project, Fargas’ robots comb desert areas, capturing drinkable water produced as a byproduct of solar energy generation. In his Biosphere project, miniature ecosystems are posited within small encapsulated spheres, capable of producing food via bioponic crop generation.</p>

<p>To learn more about Fargas’ <a href="/blog/joaquin-fargas-eden-community-awarded-mars-residencies/">work and project at Mars, read the announcement on our website</a>.</p>

<h2 id=the-eden-community-creative-ai-infrastructures>The Eden Community: “Creative AI Infrastructures”</h2>

<p>The second residency has been awarded to the community at Mars developing Project Eden, under the “Creative AI Infrastructures” track of the open call.</p>

<p>Eden is an infrastructure of AI entities, semi-automated bots and web applications which interact through text-to-image or text-to-text media generation systems.</p>

<figure>

		<figcaption>Garden of Eden image created by the Abraham bot</figcaption>
	
</figure>

<p>This award brings together Eden’s technical platform creators, artists, and plug-in software developers to create an artist-centric platform enabling work with visual representations and tools in artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The award allocates financial resources to the Eden project, including the possibility for team members and artists to interact with and gain support from the international technical and creative community of Thoughtworks.</p>

<p>Sponsoring a democratized, non-hierarchical collaborative facilitates new possibilities between toolkit creators and the artists who use these developing technologies.</p>

<p>To learn more about <a href="/blog/joaquin-fargas-eden-community-awarded-mars-residencies/">the Eden community read the announcement on our website</a>.</p>

<h2 id=the-martian-experience>The Martian Experience</h2>

<p>Mars College is a nomadic educational program, R&amp;D Lab and residential community in the desert area of Bombay Beach, California. Artists will arrive in Southern California in preparation for their time in the desert at the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Thoughtworks Arts partnership with Mars College enables facilitated remote access to Thoughtworks’ global community of technical and creative professionals during residencies. The residencies will take place on-site in the Bombay Beach desert from January 1 through to March 31, 2023.</p>

<h2 id=cnmat-welcomes-olivia-ting-as-artist-in-residence>CNMAT Welcomes Olivia Ting as Artist-in-Residence</h2>

<p>Olivia Ting, who began her <a href="/newsletters/olivia-ting-andy-slater-awarded-criptech-residencies/">CripTech residency at Thoughtworks Arts</a> in spring 2022, was awarded the prestigious <a href="https://cnmat.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT)</a> residency for fall 2022. CNMAT is dedicated to multidisciplinary research and the creative use of sound.</p>

</figure>

<p>CNMAT is dedicated to multidisciplinary research and the creative use of audio - bringing innovation to new and traditional sound and performance spaces.</p>

<p>During her CripTech residency at Thoughtworks Arts, Olivia is exploring the parallels between spatiality and movement, sign language, film, gesture, haptic intimacy and orchestral conducting. Her project focuses on tensions between sonority, ocular interpretation, and meaning based on her life long experience navigating environments of disruptive hearing. This new work will result in a mixed media, multi-model installation in 2023.</p>

<p>While in residence at CNMAT she will continue developing a sonic design environment and spatial/haptic translations of her audiovisual installation work with UC Berkeley professors Edmund Campion and Luke Dzwobczyk.</p>

<h2 id=volumetric-society--hardware-hack-lab-host-garden-for-drowning-descendants>Volumetric Society &amp; Hardware Hack Lab Host: Garden For Drowning Descendants</h2>

<p>Volumetric Society and Hardware Hack Lab co-hosted a <em>Meetup</em> at Thoughtworks NY on Wednesday, November 16th. Artist Eva Davidova and creative technologist Sidney San Martin gave a demo and a brief introduction of the interactive, mixed reality installation <a href="https://www.harvestworks.org/aug-27-oct-31garden-for-drowning-descendant-by-eva-davidova/">Garden For Drowning Descendants, recently exhibited at Harvestworks</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>A discussion on the collaborative aspects of the piece explored the conceptual and complex interplay between the hardware, software and human interaction factors of the multi-player experience. Sidney San Martin talked about the customized code and innovative solutions he developed during both the prototyping and implementation phases.</p>

<p>The event explored a simple framework one could use including terminology, audience interaction, and creative development solutions. It promoted, supported, and facilitated the participation of everyone towards the creation of virtual worlds melding entangled with the physical.</p>
