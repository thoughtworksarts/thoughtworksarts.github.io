<p>For the first time ever, Art-A-Hack™ was in St. Petersburg, Russia for <a href="http://cyland.org/lab/cyland-projects/cyfest11/">CYFEST 2018</a>, produced in collaboration with <a href="http://cyland.org/lab/">CYLAND MediaArtLab</a>. Artists, programmers and creative practitioners <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOADin8YRoc">teamed up to develop their ideas over two consecutive weekends</a> before presenting final projects in a public opening at the Berthold Centre in St. Petersburg on February 10th.</p>

<p>Projects from this Art-A-Hack included <em>Digital Hologram</em>, a projected, animated hologram that responds to a typed question asked to a Google AI API; <em>Word Cloud</em>, that produced sonic and visual elements relating to questions asked to the ‘emotional’ response of IBM’s Watson API;  and <em>Blinking</em>, which used Open CV to detect nuances in an observer’s blinking to edit a movie. <em>Hologram</em> will be shown at Tate Modern’s Tate Exchange special program, March 6 - 11, 2018.</p>

<p>Applications are now being accepted for our next ThoughtWorks Arts residency for Summer 2018: Mechanics and Movement.  We are looking for artists who are actively exploring these realms to produce surprising twists and turns in the non-verbal dance between code, gears, blood, flesh and inspiration. Although language is an important aspect to this field, we are more interested in non-verbal cues and responses. Please help spread the word and share the <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2018-mechanical-movement/">Open Call</a>. Deadline for applications is March, 26th, 2018.  </p>
