        <p>Karen Palmer, filmmaker and “storyteller from the future” has spent the last 6 months at Thoughtworks as our Artist in Residence, focused on AI for her emotionally responsive immersive film, RIOT.</p>

<p>During the residency, Thoughtworks developers have written and open-sourced an emotional expression analysis system named <a href=https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/EmoPy>EmoPy</a>, building on the work Karen did with AI researcher <a href="http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~eesthhm/">Dr. Hongying Meng</a> of Brunel University in London.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>The system is performing well under test, and is usable by anyone for a variety of purposes. It is also fully integrated as an improved emotion detection system at the core of the new version of Karen’s RIOT installation.</p>

<p>Leading the technical development effort is ThoughtWorker <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelica-perez-56a501100/">Angelica Perez</a>, a graduate from Stanford specializing in artificial intelligence research. RIOT is Angelica’s first project since joining Thoughtworks in July 2017.</p>

<p>During the last six months, Karen has also completed a TED Residency, and exhibited her work at the Future of Storytelling festival on Staten Island. Her work and her residency at Thoughtworks have been featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katmustatea/2017/12/30/this-filmmaker-from-the-future-can-teach-you-to-channel-your-fear/">Forbes</a>, <a href=https://www.fastcompany.com/40498786/when-your-fear-is-the-remote-control>Fast Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/13/riot-2-interactive-film-karen-palmer-interview/">Engadget</a>. Thoughtworks team member Stephanie Weber was inspired by the project to write an article exploring <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/artificial-intelligence-criminal-justice-system/">how artificial intelligence is transforming the criminal justice system</a>.</p>
