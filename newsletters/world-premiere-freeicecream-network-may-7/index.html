<h2 id=about-h0t-club>About h0t club</h2>

<p>During h0t club’s 16-week residency at Thoughtworks Arts and CounterPulse the artists developed performing robots who respond to sensors and cameras placed throughout CounterPulse’s project space, moving autonomously and communicating with one another via a wireless network. This hybrid virtual/physical network of human and non-human agents is influenced and guided by the emergent behaviors of the system’s inhabitants.</p>

<p>May 7th’s showcase is an extension of their previous work:</p>

<h2 id=dilate-ensemble-and-sarah-weaver-of-nownetarts-in-conversation>Dilate Ensemble and Sarah Weaver of NowNetArts: In Conversation</h2>

<p>Dilate Ensemble joined special guest <a href="https://www.sarahweaver.org/">Sarah Weaver</a>, director of <a href="https://nownetarts.org/">NowNetArts</a> (NY), for a conversation in the  field of network arts. This event was part of the “Improvising the Net(Work)” residency in partnership with <a href="https://counterpulse.org/">CounterPulse</a>.</p>

<p>The conversation focused on Dilate Ensemble’s unique explorations pushing the boundaries of telematic networks resulting in their CATENA performance in January.</p>

<p>CATENA, a non-looping visual and densely textured sound experience had performers and audience members explore livestreams from two different physical spaces inside CounterPulse’s Tenderloin San Francisco building. Seamlessly integrated remote, distributed, and off-site sound and movement performances were mixed into the live time environment. CATENA interrogated what the imprint of a physical space and the bodies within can be given the harsh restrictions imposed during Covid lockdown.</p>

<p>Dilate Ensemble includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carole Kim (California): video installation, direction</li>
  <li>Gloria Damijan (Vienna): extended toy pianos, percussion</li>
  <li>Scott L. Miller (Minnesota): Kyma, electronics</li>
  <li>Luisa Muhr (New York): voice</li>
  <li>Jon Raskin (California): sax, concertina, voice, electronics, recycled materials</li>
  <li>With special guest: Shinichi Iova-Koga: dance</li>
</ul>
