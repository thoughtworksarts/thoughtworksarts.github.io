        <p>Thoughtworks Arts Improvising the Net(Work) residents h0t club, featuring Miller Puckette (author of PureData), Kate Bergstrom, and Martim S. Galvão debuted their experimental multimedia performance Freeicecream.network at <a href="https://counterpulse.org/event/innerspace2022/">Counterpulse’s Homecoming Gala</a> on May 7th, in San Francisco.</p>

</figure>

<p>Freeicecream.network is an experimental multimedia performance that explores how our desire for connection and delicious treats entangles us with networks of information technologies.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>During the world premiere of freeicecream.network three human performers and three telepresence robots (appearing as orange traffic cones) communicate through sensors and cameras placed throughout CounterPulse’s theater.</p>

<figure>

		<figcaption>Humans and robots perform ice cream dance</figcaption>
	
</figure>

<p>These interactions lead to a distributed decision-making process, triggering videos and seemingly fun events during the performance. The emergent events, which explored techniques of embedded surveillance were defined by a changing set of system-wide modes. Each mode introduced new interactive logics between performers, robots, and participants highlighting the seductive way individuals are enticed to give up autonomy and control in mediated networks.</p>

<p>The performance revolves around consumer/audience driven enthusiasm for “free ice cream” (and other seemingly “free” products and services). Audiences  engage with the interactive hybrid network that underpins the performance and receive a gift of a real “free” ice cream sandwich as a reward for their participation.</p>

<p>Plans for upcoming iterations of freeicecream.network will invite participants to take the place of the performer, exploring the space and human-computer interactions firsthand.</p>

<h2 id=thoughtworks-arts-wants-to-send-you-to-mars>Thoughtworks Arts Wants To Send You To Mars</h2>
<p>— that is Mars.college</p>

<p>In the new post-lockdown era, what are we on the brink of? Ecological, democratic and social anxieties demand we remake our futures. Do viable alternatives exist to allow us to cohabit the planet with reimagined technologies, renewable resources, rewired communities and low impact lifestyles? What can be accomplished if it all falls apart? What new horizons can inspire and prepare us?</p>

<p>Thoughtworks Arts seeks two artists-in-residence for separate but parallel residencies on-site at Mars.college, an educational program, R&amp;D Lab and off-grid residential community in the desert area of Bombay Beach, California. Mars is geographically remote but digitally connected, cultivating a low-cost, high-tech lifestyle exploring emerging technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Application deadline: September 12, 2022</strong></p>

<p>The New York chapter of Hardware Hack Lab returned on Tuesday, June 14th for a special co-hacking session and performance from London based Clémence Debaig of Unwired Dance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.unwireddancetheatre.com/">Unwired Dance Theatre</a> makes immersive and playable experiences for remote and in-person audiences, virtual stages, galleries and unconventional sites.</p>

<p>Using networked wearables in XR, Clémence and collaborators work at the intersection of dance and technology. They question our sense of empathy, connection and remoteness, particularly when mediated through technology.</p>

<p>In the coming months, other special in-person lab events will be planned, setting the stage for a return to regular hack lab events in the future. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hardwarehacklab/">Follow Hardware Hack Lab</a> for updates.</p>

<p><strong>Catie Cuan</strong> is working with <a href=https://everydayrobots.com/thinking/experiments-and-explorations-robots-as-musical-instruments>Everyday Robots</a> to  map individual joint velocities onto musical tracks played through robots. As a result, the robot makes music as it moves. The aim of this experimental project is to help make general purpose robots more legible and relatable.</p>

<p>On July 6th Catie performed at Smithsonian Arts and Industry Building. This choreorobotics dance was part of the <a href=https://www.si.edu/exhibitions/futures%3Aevent-exhib-6535>Futures</a> closing; it was the first robot dance performance in Smithsonian history and the culmination of her June Futurist-in-Residence. On March 25th Catie traveled to Washington, D.C. to see a statue of herself at SmithsonianAIB, for the exhibit, <a href="https://ifthenexhibit.org/"><em>If Then She Can</em>, STEM</a>. This monumental exhibit of 120 3-D printed statues celebrates contemporary women innovators in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and features the most statues of real women ever assembled together.</p>

<p><strong>Moon Ribas and Neil Harbisson</strong> were  <a href="https://aib.si.edu/futuristinresidence/">Futurists-in-Residence</a> at the Smithsonian Arts + Industries Building in March. Moon further developed The Pregnancy Sense, a cyborg organ that allows her partner Quim to listen in real-time to the fluids of the baby’s amniotic sac and heartbeat through bone-conducted headphones. During their residency, Neil and Moon invited visitors to explore various artificial senses and encouraged discussion on what a post-human future would look like.</p>
