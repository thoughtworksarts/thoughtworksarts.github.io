        <p>Dear Friends: We hope you and yours are staying safe and healthy as we all face and adjust to the new realities of life.</p>

<p>Many of us in arts communities are dealing with canceled and postponed events, exhibitions, conferences - work that constitutes much of our livelihoods. We have <em>compiled a selection of resources for artists below</em>, which we hope you may find useful.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>In response to COVID-19, ThoughtWorks Arts has moved most of its operations entirely online. This includes a new, virtual Hardware Hack Lab in NYC, as well as our upcoming residencies.</p>

<h2 id=synthetic-media-residency-awarded-to-nouf-aljowaysir-and-james-coupe>Synthetic Media Residency Awarded to Nouf Aljowaysir and James Coupe</h2>

<p>We are delighted to welcome two pioneering artists for our <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2020-synthetic-media/">Synthetic Media residency</a>, to take place over the summer of 2020. Due to COVID-19, we are arranging for them to take place fully online, with the artists participating from their respective homes and studios.</p>

<p><strong>Nouf Aljowaysir</strong> is a <a href="http://www.noufaljowaysir.com/">Saudi-born, New York-based creative technologist and interactive experience designer</a>, as well as the lead researcher at Havas New York, where her focus is on creating AI prototypes for tools and design. Nouf’s work explores the role of tech in culture and personal space, and looks at how technological advances can become a means of domination, control, and exploitation.</p>

<p>Her work has been shown in galleries and festivals in the US and Europe, including the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), SXSW in 2019, and was selected for a Sundance New Frontier Story Lab Residency.</p>

<p><strong>James Coupe</strong> is a <a href="http://jamescoupe.com/">British-born, Seattle-based artist</a> investigating facial recognition software and computer algorithms in relation to popular media and surveillance.</p>

<p>He has been making work for over twenty years, exhibiting at the International Center of Photography (ICP) in New York City, the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art in Toronto, and has received an Honorable Mention for interactive art at the Prix Ars Electronica.</p>

<h2 id=thoughtworks-and-karen-palmer-featured-in-wired-magazine>ThoughtWorks and Karen Palmer Featured in Wired Magazine</h2>

<p>Artist <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/karen-palmer/">Karen Palmer</a>, whose work challenges the societal implications of A.I. by using immersive film installations was <a href=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/karen-palmer-racist-bias>featured in the March edition of WIRED UK</a>, both online and in print.</p>

</figure>

<p>The article highlights Karen’s 2017 A.I. residency at ThoughtWorks Arts where she worked with ThoughtWorks employees to research algorithms and datasets. Based on this research, the team created <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/emopy-emotional-expression-toolkit/">EmoPy, an open-source Facial Expression Recognition (FER) toolkit</a> to help democratize access to the technology.</p>

<p>The WIRED feature also goes into depth about Karen’s latest work <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/karen-palmer-exhibits-perception-cooper-hewitt-design-museum-nyc/">Perception iO</a>, an exhibit sponsored by the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. Karen worked with ThoughtWorks to develop an immersive film that exposes how our hidden biases can be explored through simulation of policing scenarios.</p>

<p>Perception iO became an integral <a href="https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/2318800037/">installation at the Coopper Hewitt Museum’s exhibition Face Values</a>. The article relays that Karen is using it as a testing ground for her next film which will emphasize how A.I. is a human rights issue.</p>

<h2 id=aibo-premieres-at-the-estonian-academy-of-music>AIBO Premieres at the Estonian Academy of Music</h2>

<p>On February 22nd, Ellen Pearlman’s new emotionally intelligent artificially intelligent brainwave opera <em>AIBO</em> had its world premiere  at the Estonian Academy of Music’s <a href="https://estonianworld.com/culture/the-estonian-academy-of-music-and-theatre-opens-a-new-concert-and-performance-centre/">state of the art Black Box Theater</a> in Tallinn.</p>

<p>The opera investigates Artificial Intelligence and its effects on both fascism and love. In the performance, human emotions are displayed on a bodysuit of light, and synthetic emotions display as red, yellow or green hues in the performance space.</p>

<p>Viewers take part in an interaction between Eva, played by actor Sniedze Strauta, and AIBO, a ‘sicko’ AI. Eva wears an <a href="https://www.emotiv.com/">Emotiv EEG brainwave headset</a> connected to a bodysuit of light designed by smart textiles designer Dila Demir.</p>

<p>AIBO’s response is generated via a custom built <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2 AI</a>, created by Ellen and programmed by ThoughtWorks developers Jonathan Heng, Wasawat Somno and Andrew Zhou, with help from technical director Hans Gunter Lock.</p>

<p>The opera explores two questions: “Can an AI be fascist? And can an AI have epigenetic, or inherited traumatic memory? These questions raise issues imagining a potential future where humans and machines may one day merge consciousness.”</p>

<p>In 2019, Pearlman received the European Union’s prestigious <a href="https://vertigo.starts.eu/calls/starts-residencies-call-3/residencies/aibo/detail/">Vertigo Starts Residency Laureate Award</a> to develop AIBO.</p>
