			<p>Thoughtworks Arts runs programs incubating artist and technologist collaborations, empowering investigations into impacts of emerging technologies on industry, culture and society.</p>
			<p>Art and technology partnerships present a unique and <a href="/blog/how-artists-reshape-emerging-technology-research/">powerful lens for engaging with technology</a>. Art enables freedom to make large, cross-disciplinary conceptual and physical leaps across technical, scientific, industrial, creative and societal areas.</p>

			<p>The Art-A-Hack program, run in locations including St. Petersburg, Russia and in New York City, curates and facilitates the creation of prototypes. We ‘collide’ professionals of varied backgrounds into teams, including artists, technologists, hardware and software developers, designers, musicians, filmmakers, performers, animators, and much more.</p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>Doing this enables collaboration between people who otherwise might not have the opportunity to work together. Typically, this results in an exhibitable prototype that expresses an idea or starts a journey.</p>
			<p>Projects created at Art-A-Hack have been featured by Tribeca Immersive, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate Exchange at the Tate Modern in London, SPRING/BREAK as part of New York's Armory Week and the RIXC Art Science Festival in Riga, Latvia.</p>
