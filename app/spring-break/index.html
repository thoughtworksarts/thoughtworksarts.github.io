      <div class="text">
         <p>The exhibition, sponsored by the media art center <a href="http://www.harvestworks.org/">Harvestworks</a>, was comprised of works incubated by Thoughtworks Arts programs over the last four years. This includes work from <a href="https://artahack.io">Art-A-Hack</a> and the <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io">Thoughtworks Arts Residency</a>, and by the directors of these programs, Andrew McWilliams and Ellen Pearlman, who are also practicing artists.</p>
         <p>The show’s curator Lee Tusman, says:</p>

         <blockquote>
           <p>These works show the tipping point of innovation socially transforming our world over the next 25-30 years. They cross over into areas of virtuality and nature and the artificial and the real. As the real (nature/climate change) is threatened, the artificial (VR/AR/immersion) grows. As one world is being destroyed, another opens up.</p>
         </blockquote>

         <p>The exhibited works are listed below, each showcasing the intersection between art, technology and society.</p>

         <h2>Dual Brains</h2>

         <p>Dual Brains is a <a href="https://artahack.io/projects/dual-brains/">real-time visual performance</a> of the brain data of two performers who are wearing 3D-printed brainwave headsets. The work was incubated as part of Art-A-Hack 2014 and 2016, and first performed at Thoughtworks New York.</p>

         <p>The work showcases shared empathy between two brains, creating a live-time visual and sonic environment.</p>

      <div class="text">
         <p>First conceptualized by artist Eva Lee, the piece uses custom EEG headsets created by 3D fashion designer Aaron Trocola. The software behind the performance was <a href="https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/Dual_Brains">extended and refined</a> for the exhibition by Thoughtworks developer Julien Deswaef.</p>

         <h2>RIOT</h2>

         <p>RIOT is an <a href="/blog/karen-palmer-ai-residency/">emotionally responsive, live-action film</a> with 3D sound, which uses facial expression recognition technology to navigate through a dangerous riot in progress. In the experience, audience’s emotions are used to adjust the story of the film, so that their emotions drive the narrative of the film forwards.</p>

         <h2>Suppressed Images</h2>

         <p>Suppressed Images is a <a href="/projects/suppressed-images/">graphic short story</a> exploring the implications and issues around DNA, identity and genetic surveillance, and imagining what types of futures might unfold.</p>

         <p>The story illustrates a collaboration between the then-incarcerated whistleblower Chelsea Manning and artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg. In 2015, Chelsea sent a cheek swab from inside military prison, which Heather subjected to DNA analysis. A 3D-printed portrait was produced based on the DNA.</p>

         <p>The piece has been shown previously at the <a href="https://www.humanimpactsinstitute.org/cca2017">Human Impacts Institute</a>, and at <a href="http://www.harvestworks.org/calls-to-action/">Harvestworks</a> in New York.</p>

         <h2>Utopia 1.0: Post Neo-Futurist-Capitalism</h2>

         <p>Utopia 1.0  is a <a href="https://artahack.io/projects/utopia/">first-person expedition</a> to Second Life, the once thriving virtual 3D online world, in search of what remains. The film was shot ‘on location’ within Second Life by filmmaker Annie Berman, and was <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/1806">screened at the Museum of Modern Art</a>, New York in 2015.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text">
         <p>The film shows ruins that do not decay, speculative real estate, realtors' offices, wide open spaces with 'for sale' signs, Harvard University’s virtual ‘sandbox’, and an art gallery on its last days.</p>

         <p>In a satirical nod to current techno-utopian hype around virtuality, Annie led an Art-A-Hack team to develop a virtual reality version of her film experience, which was presented at this exhibition.</p>

         <h2>To Be With Hamlet</h2>

         <p>To Be With Hamlet is the <a href="https://artahack.io/projects/hamlet-vr/">world's first live-action telepresence</a> production of Shakespeare via virtual reality. This project, whose initial creation was incubated by Art-A-Hack, went on to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017.</p>
      </div>

      {% include image file='/images/posts-special/spring-break/to-be-with-hamlet.jpg'
         alt='A man uses VR headgear to explore a virtual Shakespeare performance'
         caption='An audience member explores \'To Be With Hamlet\'' %}

      <div class="text">
         <p>Actors in remote locations interact with audience members via live microphone feeds, motion capture and real-time telepresence technology. Audiences together watch a live scene, able to move freely about the scene and view the actors from any angle.</p>

         <p>The work was conceptualized and created by Javier Molina and David Gochfeld with the support of NYU Tandon School of Engineering.</p>

         <h2>Relativity Five</h2>

         <p>Relativity Five is a table-top heart sensing and reflecting light sculpture by artist Sofy Yuditskaya. The work is an extension of a <a href="https://artahack.io/projects/aurora-borealis/">concept incubated at Art-A-Hack</a>, in which lasers are used to display viewer’s biometrics.</p>
      </div>
