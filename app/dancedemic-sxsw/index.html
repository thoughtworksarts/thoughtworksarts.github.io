         <h2>About the panel</h2>
         <p>Our proposed panel is <a href="https://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/107847">"Take Back the Net (Work): Lockdown = Innovation"</a>. This panel will explore amazing work incubated over six weeks this summer by newly-formed international teams of artists, performers and technologists during COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

      <div class="text">
         <p>These teams, working across India, Brazil, Estonia, the US and UK, integrated live biometrics into audio-visual livestream performances as part of the 39th annual Battery Dance Festival. This enabled two immigrant dancers now in the US to express their stories of adversity and empowerment through digitally augmented live performances.</p>

         <p>In this way, restrictions surrounding COVID-19 lockdown became the catalyst for global collaborations between artists and indie organizations.</p>
         <p>The panel will feature a dancer from Iraqi Kurdistan, an Estonian engineer pioneering innovative streaming technology, a US-based program director, and a technical producer, all of whom were members of of the “DANCEDEMIC” team who produced this pioneering work.</p>

      <div class="text">
         <p>The panel will explore challenges of global remote collaborations, networks as products and solutions, expanding the virtual body via biometrics, the democratization of streaming production and how it fostered a model for artistic and cultural engagement in the 2020s and beyond.</p>
