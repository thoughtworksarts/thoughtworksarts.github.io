Dates: Sept 18 - Dec 22, 2017

Thoughtworks, a global software consultancy with an arts residency based in New York City seeks an artist/technologist who works in their art practice with issues surrounding the design, use and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). AI simulates human intelligence using computer systems that learn, reason and self-correct based on programming and algorithms. The artist does not need to be an expert in programming AI systems, but a basic understanding is helpful. AI can enhance the human experience, but can also contribute towards amplifying pre-existing social prejudices and biases, thereby restricting the free flow of individuals, communities and entire populations in untold ways.

The social and economic impacts of AI are already being felt in daily life, and increasingly will have the potential to lead to social unrest and job loss. As AI becomes more robust, it has the potential to create a Kafkaesque environment where no human being is held accountable for the results of automated decisions impacting peopleâ€™s lives, and there are limited, time-consuming, dangerous or non-existent avenues of redress. The singularity, while of interest, is not our primary concern, as over-focusing on connectivity ignores the increasing effect AI has on society today. We are particularly interested in highlighting issues around migration and filtration, but are open to other ideas mentioned above as well.

## Logistics

Thoughtworks will provide a work space, facilitation in midtown Manhattan, and access to guides and consultants, as well as appropriate resources as the project progresses. It does not provide housing or work visas, and is for the artist only. It does not include family members.

This fourteen week residency comes with a modest stipend of $10,000, and assistance, if necessary in supplying a letter of intent to any external funding agencies that might facilitate with the residency. Individuals who need to apply for visas should be particularly sensitive to recent issues surrounding work visas and consult with their own countries authorities for assistance in crafting their applications to visit New York.

Applicants must submit a proposal by email to leah@thoughtworksarts.io by the application deadline of June 8th 2017. Your proposal should tell us who you are, what your project idea is, and how you plan to implement it. It should also include the skills you have, and the skills you require for the project. Where there are skills required which you do not have or cannot supply, please let us know.

Send applications to leah@thoughtworksarts.io by June 8th, 2017.
