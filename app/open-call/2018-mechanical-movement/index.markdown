Dates: June 4 - September 21, 2018

Thoughtworks, a global software consultancy with an arts residency based in New York City seeks an artist/technologist who works in their art practice with issues of robotics, and the kinesthetics of human-robotic interactions. The artist does not need to be an expert in robotics or programming, but it will be helpful if the artist has a basic understanding, some level of experience in robotics, and/or a network of consultants.

Robotics is usually associated with repetitive tasks, or machine automation. However, in the future, robotics will be integrated into aspects of human love, war, sex, caretaking and emotion, and more. This Thoughtworks Arts Open Call looks for artists who are actively exploring these realms to produce surprising twists and turns in the non-verbal dance between code, gears, blood, flesh and inspiration. Although language is an important aspect to this field, we are more interested in non-verbal cues and responses.

This open call is supported by our partners at the [Consortium for Research &amp; Robotics](http://consortiumrr.com/).

## Logistics

Thoughtworks will provide a work space, facilitation in midtown Manhattan, and access to guides and consultants, as well as appropriate resources as the project progresses. It does not provide housing or work visas, and is for the artist only. It does not include family members.

This sixteen week residency comes with a modest stipend of $11,000, and assistance, if necessary in supplying a letter of intent to any external funding agencies that might facilitate with the residency. Individuals who need to apply for visas should be particularly sensitive to recent issues surrounding work visas and consult with their own countries authorities for assistance in crafting their applications to visit New York.

Applicants must submit a proposal by email to [apply@thoughtworksarts.io](mailto:apply@thoughtworksarts.io) by the application deadline of March 26, 2018. Your proposal should tell us who you are, what your project idea is, and how you plan to implement it. It should also include the skills you have, and the skills and equipment you require for the project. Where there are skills required which you do not have or cannot supply, please let us know. We will contact applicants with final selection information by April 16th, 2018.

Send applications to [apply@thoughtworksarts.io](mailto:apply@thoughtworksarts.io) by midnight March 26th, 2018.
