Artist-engineer Joaquín Fargas integrates art, science, and technology into his arts practice through combining both speculative and actual eco-utopian proposals, environmental preservation, and the interrelationship between living beings and the future. Fargas explores biological materials and technological media aimed at generating dialogue discussing hybrid ecologies. 

Since the early 2000s he has incorporated digital communication technologies and robotics into his work. In 2005 he started using biotechnology, and in 2008 founded the first BioArtLab at Maimonides University in Buenos Aires, now known as the Latinamerican BioArt Lab by UAI ([Universidad Abierta Interamericana](https://uai.edu.ar/)) where he serves as professor of Art and Technology. 

Between 2010 and 2013 Fargas was Executive Director of the Network for the Popularization of Science and Technology at [UNESCO (RedPop)](https://en.unesco.org/events/public-engagement-science-and-technology-latin-america-and-caribbean-redpop-experience). He used the RedPop channel to raise awareness about environmental issues, quantum computing, space, and artificial intelligence. His own practice examines the relationship between humans, technology, the future, and the environment. Many of his projects contain an educational component.

Joaquín leads workshops on tech, mixed media, NFTs, and crypto art. His work has been exhibited in museums, galleries, and biennials worldwide where he develops ‘site specific’ installations and performances. He also presents and lectures at academic conferences and is an accomplished TED talk speaker.
