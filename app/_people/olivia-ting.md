   <p>Olivia Ting creates audio-visual spatial videos that weave sound and scene fragments, representing how she experiences the world around her. Olivia’s fascination with moving image stems from her hearing impairment — she is deaf in one ear and has 22% hearing in the other.</p>
   <p>Without hearing aids, Olivia perceives almost no sound. Since receiving a cochlear implant, Olivia has returned to her music training to examine how her brain re-learns to hear again, an amalgamation of memory and digital algorithms.</p>

Olivia Ting creates audio-visual spatial videos that weave sound and scene fragments, representing how she experiences the world around her. Olivia’s fascination with moving image stems from her hearing impairment — she is deaf in one ear and has 22% hearing in the other. Without hearing aids, Olivia perceives almost no sound.

Since receiving a cochlear implant, Olivia has returned to her music training to examine how her brain re-learns to hear again, an amalgamation of memory and digital algorithms.

Olivia’s work has been exhibited in museums and performance centers across the US, including Z-Space (San Francisco), Richardson Bay Audubon Society (Tiburon), ODC Theater (San Francisco), and the Worth Ryder Gallery at the Berkeley Art Museum. She has received project-based support from the California Arts Council and the National Arts and Disability Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Olivia worked as a graphic designer in New York City for several years before returning to San Francisco, where she now works on collaborative spatial video projections with choreographers. She holds an MFA in Art Practice from U.C. Berkeley.
