Nouf is a Saudi-born, New York-based artist and senior design technologist at Medium. Her work focuses on the impact of current and emerging technologies on society, ranging from interactive physical installations to political Twitter bots. With a light sense of humor and irony, Nouf's projects criticize how rapid technological advances have become a means of domination, control, and exploitation.

Her work has been exhibited in galleries and festivals in the US and Europe, including the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), South-by-Southwest (SXSW), NeurIPS Conference for Creativity and Design, the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition and at the Cannes XR Virtual as part of Tribeca Film Festivalâ€™s selected XR projects, and was selected for a Sundance New Frontier Story Lab Residency.

Nouf's project Salaf was the winning entry to the Computer Vision Art Gallery competition in 2020, selected on the basis of "technical novelty, aesthetic merit, or conceptual strength." Nouf serves as a dedicated mentor at NEW INC incubator, and has spoken at Rethink! Festival as part of Milan Design Week. At Medium, her work involves designing and prototyping new ideas to create opportunities for Medium's product teams.
