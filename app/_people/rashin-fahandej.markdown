Rashin Fahandej is an Iranian-American multimedia artist and filmmaker. Her projects center on marginalized voices, and the role of media, technology, and public collaboration in generating social change. A proponent of “Art as Ecosystem,” Rashin defines her projects as “Poetic Cyber Movement for Social Justice,” where art mobilizes a plethora of voices by creating connections between public places and virtual spaces.

Rashin is the founder of *A Father’s Lullaby*, a multi-platform, co-creative project that highlights the role of men in raising children and their absence due to racial disparities in the criminal justice system. *Marginalia*, a series of poetic documentaries about Baha’i immigrants of Iranian descent, narrates a historical persecution in their homeland.

Rashin has served as an artistic director of the Rebuilding the Gwozdziec Synagogue at POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, 2017 Boston Artist-In-Residence with Mayor’s office of art and culture and 2018 Public Art Resident at Boston Center for the Arts. She is a research fellow at MIT Open Documentary Lab and the 2019 Mass Cultural Council Artist Fellow and Artist in Residence at ThoughtWork Arts.

*A Father’s Lullaby* has been awarded the [Prix Ars Electronica Award of Distinction in Digital Music and Sound Art](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/rashin-fahandej-award-of-distinction-ars-electronica/), the [James and Audrey Foster prize](https://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/2019-james-and-audrey-foster-prize), and was [exhibited at the Institute for Contemporary Arts (ICA)](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/institute-contemporary-arts-biennal-exhibits-rashin-fahandej-boston/) on the Boston waterfront Aug 21 – Dec 31, 2019.
