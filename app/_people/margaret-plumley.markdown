Margaret is a Product Strategist at Thoughtworks and the XR Practice Lead in North America. She uses her background in Product Management, Research, and Design to help clients ranging from airlines to government reach their full potential.

Before joining Thoughtworks, Margaret has worked at PlayStation, Google, Dreamworks and Microsoft. She has a Master’s Degree in Educational Technology, a Bachelor’s in Broadcast Production, attended a Fine Arts Atelier and has an art studio in Monterey, California.

As part of the [Perception iO](/projects/perception-io/) project, Margaret worked closely with Karen Palmer to storyboard the audience experience from the moment they first encounter the installation through the time they leave.

Outside of work, you can find Margaret in her art studio or down by the ocean wading in ice-cold water exploring tide pools.
