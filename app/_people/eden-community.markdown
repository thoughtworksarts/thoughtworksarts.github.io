The Eden Community refers to the community at Mars.college developing Project Eden. Project Eden is an infrastructure of AI entities, semi-automated bots and web applications that enable artists to create in new ways by using neural networks and evolving media generation systems.

The community consists of Edenâ€™s technical platform coders, artists, and plug-in software developrs building an artist centric platform enhancing visual representation tools for artificial intelligence. Community members work individually or in group projects to expand these horizons. 

The Eden Project is closely linked to creative technologist Gene Kogan, who developed the [Abraham AI bot](https://abraham.ai/) and the [Machine Learning for Art](https://ml4a.net/) toolkit and workshop series.
