With her intricate blend of dark and ethereal sounds, Sakura Tsuruta continues to push the bounds of what it means to be an electronic music producer and DJ. Her unique DJ style of intertwining rhythms and harmonies from across the globe takes people to a dystopian world, always keeping the crowd on its toes, longing for more.

The Tokyo-based artist first released her single ‘Dystopia’, in November 2019 via Bardo Records based in Slovenia. The ambient electronica piece broke ground and made its way to the Top 100 Chart in the Electronica/Downtempo. Since then, she has released another EP, ‘Made of Air’ which was released in June 2020.

She continues to live up to her hype in the underground music scene in Tokyo, constantly challenging stylistic and creative boundaries whilst making guest appearances on international radio platforms. Her global presence has reached the hearts of many, landing her a coveted spot on the Hong Kong Community Radio Residency program. In collaboration with asagi, Sakura has performed audio visual sets with MutekJP December of 2019 as well as Mutek Montreal in September of 2020. Her desire to create and innovate her music has elevated her musical performance, truly making it an immersive sensory experience.
