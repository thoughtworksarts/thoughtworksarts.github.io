Rahul De is an Infrastructure Consultant at Thoughtworks dedicated to making simpler tools to bridge the gap between Dev and Ops. As a die hard [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) fan, he is fascinated to use its power and simplicity to make infra simple too; a place where it is rarely seen but can be of immense value. Mostly based in Berlin, Rahul loves to organise and attend meetups and conferences around increasing diversity in tech, [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and food. He is always up for a (often emotional) discussion about veganism, climate change, anarcho-communism, ways to increase diversity and getting rid of static types altogether.
