<p>The first two years of Art-A-Hack included inventions, installations, collaborations, performances. This year promises more fantastic opportunities.</p>

<p>Are you interested in taking part? To apply now, please read the Open Call below and send your ideas to <a href="mailto:call2016@artahack.io">call2016@artahack.io</a>. We really want to work with you! However, <strong>please don't send an application if you can not commit to the dates of June 11, 18, 25, July 9 and July 15.</strong></p>

<p>The deadline for applications is <strong>Monday April 18</strong> - early applications are appreciated.</p>

<h2>Open Call</h2>
<p>Here's the deal: we will provide space for four Saturdays (10am-6pm) in June and July, equipment, facilitation and advice, and stellar showcase opportunities.</p>

<p>We want to hear your ideas and will team you up with like-minded souls, blasting off into the stratosphere together.</p>

<p>During four Saturdays (June 11, 18, 25 &amp; July 9) we will co-create at ThoughtWorks New York, and NYU Tandon. There will be a pre-event social on the evening of Wednesday, June 8, as well as a well-earned closing party July 15  to present your final work, chat, network and land back on the planet.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>To apply, send your ideas now to <a href="mailto:call2016@artahack.io">call2016@artahack.io</a>. Describe a project idea you want to try, the technologies you'd like to get into, or the skills you have to contribute.</p>

<ul>
<li>Please include info about your background you would like us to know about</li>
<li>If you can program, please tell us what languages you work with</li>
<li>If you can't program but are are an artist, let us know what you are thinking about creating</li>
<li>If there are social issues you are interested in, and would like to highlight those with tech, let us know</li>
<li>Please confirm that you are available for the dates listed below</li>
</ul>

<p>When we receive your applications, we will match you up with others who have complementary skills. This will help you all achieve something together as a team.</p> 

<p>This process is quite ad-hoc, and depends entirely on the mix of applications we receive. Each year we group people together around the most compelling ideas. This means your idea may not be selected, but you may be invited to participate nevertheless. Because we prioritize the creation of awesome teams with complementary skills and ideas, sometimes we can’t find the correct match for your background.</p>
