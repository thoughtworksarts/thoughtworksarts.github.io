<h2>Art-A-Hack 2015</h2>

<p>Announcing <strong>Art-A-Hack&#8482; 2</strong> - a collaborative creation between groups of artists/engineers, designers/makers, or whatever combination arises based on your project proposals.</p>

<p>The first year of Art-A-Hack included inventions, installations, collaborations, performances, which you can read about in <a href="/summer-2014/report/">the report</a> and watch in the <a href="/words/final-journey-presentations/">live-streamed video</a>. This year promises more fantastic opportunities.</p>

<p>Here's the deal: we will provide space for four Mondays (10am-6pm) in June, the equipment listed below (which you are free to use or not use), facilitation and advice, and stellar showcase opportunities.</p>

<p>We want to hear your ideas and will team you up with like-minded souls, blasting off into the stratosphere together.</p>

<p>During four Mondays <strong>(June 8, 15, 22 &amp; 29)</strong> we will co-create at <a href="http://info.thoughtworks.com/new-york/">ThoughtWorks New York</a> and other venues. There will be a pre-event social on the evening of <strong>Friday May 15th</strong> at a secret location, as well as a well-earned closing party to present your final work, chat, network and land back on the planet.</p>

<p>To apply, send your ideas now to <a href="mailto:call2015@artahack.io">call2015@artahack.io</a>.
