Dear Friends: We hope you and yours are staying safe and healthy as we all face and adjust to the new realities of life.

Many of us in arts communities are dealing with canceled and postponed events, exhibitions, conferences - work that constitutes much of our livelihoods. We have _compiled a selection of resources for artists below_, which we hope you may find useful.

<!--excerpt-ends-->

In response to COVID-19, Thoughtworks Arts has moved most of its operations entirely online. This includes a new, virtual Hardware Hack Lab in NYC, as well as our upcoming residencies.

## Synthetic Media Residency Awarded to Nouf Aljowaysir and James Coupe

We are delighted to welcome two pioneering artists for our [Synthetic Media residency](https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2020-synthetic-media/), to take place over the summer of 2020. Due to COVID-19, we are arranging for them to take place fully online, with the artists participating from their respective homes and studios.

**Nouf Aljowaysir** is a [Saudi-born, New York-based creative technologist and interactive experience designer](http://www.noufaljowaysir.com/), as well as the lead researcher at Havas New York, where her focus is on creating AI prototypes for tools and design. Nouf's work explores the role of tech in culture and personal space, and looks at how technological advances can become a means of domination, control, and exploitation.

Her work has been shown in galleries and festivals in the US and Europe, including the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), SXSW in 2019, and was selected for a Sundance New Frontier Story Lab Residency.

**James Coupe** is a [British-born, Seattle-based artist](http://jamescoupe.com/) investigating facial recognition software and computer algorithms in relation to popular media and surveillance.

He has been making work for over twenty years, exhibiting at the International Center of Photography (ICP) in New York City, the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle, the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art in Toronto, and has received an Honorable Mention for interactive art at the Prix Ars Electronica.

## Thoughtworks and Karen Palmer Featured in Wired Magazine

Artist [Karen Palmer](https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/karen-palmer/), whose work challenges the societal implications of A.I. by using immersive film installations was [featured in the March edition of WIRED UK](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/karen-palmer-racist-bias), both online and in print.

The article highlights Karen's 2017 A.I. residency at Thoughtworks Arts where she worked with Thoughtworks employees to research algorithms and datasets. Based on this research, the team created [EmoPy, an open-source Facial Expression Recognition (FER) toolkit](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/emopy-emotional-expression-toolkit/) to help democratize access to the technology.

The WIRED feature also goes into depth about Karen's latest work [Perception iO](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/karen-palmer-exhibits-perception-cooper-hewitt-design-museum-nyc/), an exhibit sponsored by the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. Karen worked with Thoughtworks to develop an immersive film that exposes how our hidden biases can be explored through simulation of policing scenarios.

Perception iO became an integral [installation at the Coopper Hewitt Museum's exhibition Face Values](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/2318800037/). The article relays that Karen is using it as a testing ground for her next film which will emphasize how A.I. is a human rights issue.

## AIBO Premieres at the Estonian Academy of Music

On February 22nd, Ellen Pearlman’s new emotionally intelligent artificially intelligent brainwave opera _AIBO_ had its world premiere  at the Estonian Academy of Music’s [state of the art Black Box Theater](https://estonianworld.com/culture/the-estonian-academy-of-music-and-theatre-opens-a-new-concert-and-performance-centre/) in Tallinn.

The opera investigates Artificial Intelligence and its effects on both fascism and love. In the performance, human emotions are displayed on a bodysuit of light, and synthetic emotions display as red, yellow or green hues in the performance space.

Viewers take part in an interaction between Eva, played by actor Sniedze Strauta, and AIBO, a ‘sicko’ AI. Eva wears an [Emotiv EEG brainwave headset](https://www.emotiv.com/) connected to a bodysuit of light designed by smart textiles designer Dila Demir.

{% include youtube id='18tqDS0VelM'
   caption='A clip from AIBO\'s premiere' %}

AIBO’s response is generated via a custom built [GPT-2 AI](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), created by Ellen and programmed by Thoughtworks developers Jonathan Heng, Wasawat Somno and Andrew Zhou, with help from technical director Hans Gunter Lock.

The opera explores two questions: “Can an AI be fascist? And can an AI have epigenetic, or inherited traumatic memory? These questions raise issues imagining a potential future where humans and machines may one day merge consciousness.”

In 2019, Pearlman received the European Union’s prestigious [Vertigo Starts Residency Laureate Award](https://vertigo.starts.eu/calls/starts-residencies-call-3/residencies/aibo/detail/) to develop AIBO.

[Our blog post goes into greater detail about AIBO's development and its debut](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/ai-brainwave-opera-world-premiere/).

## COVID-19 Support Resources
We've compiled a list of resources and virtual environments for those looking to collaborate, share, and disturb the pangs of isolation. May these connections buoy us during this storm.
- The [Artist Relief Project](https://artistreliefproject.org/) is an initiative to help artists, musicians, and performers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.
- The [NYFA "Anonymous Was A Woman" Emergency Relief Grant](https://www.nyfa.org/Content/Show/Anonymous-Was-A-Woman-Emergency-Relief-Grant) program is distributing up to $2,500 to women-identifying visual artists over the age of 40 who have been impacted by COVID-19.
- [CERF-Emergency Assistance](https://cerfplus.org/get-relief/apply-for-help/craft-emergency-relief-fund/) is for artists who've experienced a recent career threatening emergency, includes grants and/or brokered assistance.
- [Kinkade Family Foundation Emergency Grant for Curators](http://www.kinkadefamilyfoundation.org/emergencygrantforcurators) will provide one-time grants of up to $5,000 to curators experiencing unexpected emergencies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- [Mayer Foundation Economic Relief Grants](http://fdnweb.org/mayer/individuals/) are designed to provide relief grants for any individual in the New York City area.

Here's a list of spaces where artists and technologists are coming together to create community virtually.
- [Hardware Hack Lab NYC](https://hardwarehacklab.io/) is running virtual events every Wednesday evening for people wanting to explore new technology in a friendly environment, where you can meet others, learn and hack away. *[Must RSVP.](https://www.meetup.com/volumetric/)*
* [Leonardo ISAST Virtual Social Connecting Space: Coffee and Cocktails](https://www.leonardo.info/civicrm/event/info%3Freset%3D1%26id%3D489) is holding a virtual space to connect, twice-weekly. These online gatherings don’t have a theme, but offer an opportunity to connect with Leonardo's expansive art:tech community.

There are some interesting initiatives coming from the tech community on how to respond to the crisis, many of which are looking for volunteers or interested parties:
* [U.S. Digital Response](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/) is a volunteer-run, non-partisan effort to help U.S. federal, state, and local government with technology, data, design, operations, communications, project management, and more during the COVID-19 crisis.
* [Covid Tech Salon Series](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amcwill_please-rsvp-now-how-can-the-technology-sector-activity-6654402757669199872-E-ZO) is a series of conversations and publications intended to guide the tech sector as it works out how to most effectively respond to the crisis. The series is sponsored by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/). Andrew McWilliams is one of the organizers of the series, and Art-A-Hack alum Linda Raftree is the series' convener.
* [Coronavirus Tech Handbook](https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/home) is a crowdsourced resource for technologists building things related to the coronavirus outbreak.
