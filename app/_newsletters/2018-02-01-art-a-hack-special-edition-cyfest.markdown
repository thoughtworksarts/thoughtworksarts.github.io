Participants hail from St. Petersburg, as well as a large number who made the trip from Moscow specifically for the program. This unique Art-A-Hack™, produced in collaboration with [CYLAND MediaArtLab](http://cyland.org/lab/), entails teams working together for two consecutive weekends before presenting their final projects in a public opening at the Berthold Centre in St. Petersburg on February 7th, 2018.

The teams have many exciting projects underway, including interacting with a holographic character, allowing viewer to control a video narrative by blinking, and creating a visual word cloud which responds to human voice, via sentiment analysis.


## Investigating AI in Criminal Justice

During her work on Karen Palmer's RIOT project, Thoughtworks employee Stephanie Weber researched the [role AI is playing in the criminal justice system](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/artificial-intelligence-criminal-justice-system/). In Weber's write-up of the situation, she goes through topics of sentencing, risk of recidivism, and bias in automated systems, looking at the way AI is changing our perspectives on each topic.

Stephanie worked on Karen Palmer's residency project at Thoughtworks as a researcher and software developer during 2017.

## Introducing REFRESH

[REFRESH](https://refreshart.tech/) is a new art collective dedicated to diversifying the art/tech/science world, co-founded by former TWA resident, Heather Dewey Hagborg. REFRESH is the first biennial exhibit of its kind, showcasing feminist, queer, de-colonial, and historically marginalized artists. 

{% include image file='kiss-my-ars.png'
   alt='A graphic showing the #KissMyArs campaign'
   caption='#KissMyArs Social Media Campaign Image' %}

This initiative came about following the social media campaign, #KissMyArs, which Heather started in response to the gender problem perpetuated by the international arts and technology prize, the Golden Nika, awarded at the Ars Electronica festival annually. Heather co-authored a piece in the Guardian [explaining the rationale behind the #KissMyArs](https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2016/sep/12/ars-electronica-festival-gender).

REFRESH currently has an [open call for a Curatorial & Engagement Fellowship](https://www.eyebeam.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Curatorial-Fellowship-Eyebeam.pdf). Application deadline is February 14th, 2018.
