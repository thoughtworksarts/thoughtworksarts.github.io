Participants hail from St. Petersburg, as well as a large number who made the trip from Moscow specifically for the program. This unique Art-A-Hack™, produced in collaboration with [CYLAND MediaArtLab](http://cyland.org/lab/), entails teams working together for two consecutive weekends before presenting their final projects in a public opening at the Berthold Centre in St. Petersburg on February 7th, 2018.

The teams have many exciting projects underway, including interacting with a holographic character, allowing viewer to control a video narrative by blinking, and creating a visual word cloud which responds to human voice, via sentiment analysis.


## Investigating AI in Criminal Justice

During her work on Karen Palmer's RIOT project, ThoughtWorks employee Stephanie Weber researched the [role AI is playing in the criminal justice system](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/artificial-intelligence-criminal-justice-system/). In Weber's write-up of the situation, she goes through topics of sentencing, risk of recidivism, and bias in automated systems, looking at the way AI is changing our perspectives on each topic.

## Introducing REFRESH

[REFRESH](https://refreshart.tech/) is a new art collective dedicated to diversifying the art/tech/science world, co-founded by former TWA resident, Heather Dewey Hagborg. REFRESH is the first biennial exhibit of its kind, showcasing feminist, queer, de-colonial, and historically marginalized artists. 

{% include image.html file='kiss-my-ars.png'
   caption='#KissMyArs Social Media Campaign Image' %}

This initiative came about following the social media campaign, #KissMyArs, which Heather started in response to the gender problem perpetuated by the international arts and technology prize, the Golden Nika, awarded at the Ars Electronica festival annually. Heather co-authored a piece in the Guardian [explaining the rationale behind the #KissMyArs](https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2016/sep/12/ars-electronica-festival-gender).

REFRESH currently has an [open call for a Curatorial & Engagement Fellowship](https://www.eyebeam.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Curatorial-Fellowship-Eyebeam.pdf). Application deadline is February 14th, 2018.
