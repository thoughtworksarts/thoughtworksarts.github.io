title : "SingularityNet Partners With ThoughtWorks Arts"
---

We are thrilled to be joining forces with the world’s first decentralized AI platform, [SingularityNET](https://singularitynet.io), for our next residency: [The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence via Blockchain](https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2019-democratization-ai-blockchain/).

Blockchains and AI are revolutionary technologies that will imminently change how humans and industry exist forever.

<!--excerpt-ends-->

Currently the two are somewhat separate, except in niche crypto currency applications. But SingularityNET’s CEO, [Dr. Ben Goertze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJrtpwgQozw&amp=&feature=youtu.be)l, sees their widespread combined potential and set out to create a system that not only captures the power of AI, but one that also is open to absolutely everyone, ensuring that AI is transparent and decentralized.

It was this idea of individuals having better access and insight to AI development that became the inspiration of our residency's key theme. We’re so excited to now have SingularityNet on board. and look forward to exploring creative approaches to the implementation of a decentralized AI through a unique art work for this upcoming residency.

This open call is also in collaboration with our other partner [Snark.Art](https://snark.art/), a developer of blockchain for art.

Our open call for The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence via Blockchain is still open and ends on July 31st. The residency will take place  September 30th, 2019 — January 31, 2020.


## Adrianne Wortzel To Screen The Sentient Thespian at the Landmark Anthology Film Archives in New York

The film was shot on location at the [Consortium for Research & Robotics](https://consortiumrr.com/), hosted by the Pratt Institute in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Her film features their 16ft tall industrial robotic arm. It also features a non-humanoid robot called [MekaMon](https://mekamon.com/), manufactured by [Reach Robotics](https://reachrobotics.com/) in the UK, and explores a narrative on technological transformations and humanity as we advance into the 4th industrial revolution. Elements of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” also swirl into the film's theme, adding a poignant juxtaposition.

Adrianne Wortzel is an artist whose works include tele-robotic/robotic performance productions, interactive installations, photography, videos, art objects and writings. Her works display the arc of human experience of technological advances as they emerge, become pervasive, and eventually obsolete.

You can learn more about Adrianne and her project on [her resident page](https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/adrianne-wortzel/), and [watch a teaser of the film on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/329474208).

Her screening of The Sentient Thespian will start at 7:15 on Wednesday, July 17th. There will be a reception starting at 5:30. Address: 32 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003. Tickets available at the door.


## Rashin Fahandej Begins Her Volumetric Filmmaking Residency

Our newest resident Rashin Fahandej has begun her volumetric filmmaking residency. Rashin has hit the ground running here in New York, and is actively working with our partner and Emmy-award winning studio, [Scatter](http://scatter.nyc/), using their latest [Depthkit](https://www.depthkit.tv/) tools to further expand her social change project, A Father's Lullaby.

## News from Past ThoughtWorks Arts Residents

**Karen Palmer** was the keynote at [AT&TShape](https://shape.att.com/): Where AI Meets Next-Gen Immersive Storytelling. She was also [interviewed by PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/news/369219/at-t-shape-where-ai-meets-next-gen-immersive-storytelling?fbclid=IwAR1E3o0dLSEf-tZqRuqw4I9PoJAwZijGOYYuqfcMKYurBMc10WPO9D623WI) where they chatted about VR filmmaking and AI-powered storytelling. The article also included a GitHub link to the EmoPy code developed during her residency

**hannes bend** guided his first AI breathing workshop at Google. Hannes helps to develop machine learning systems and biometrics that reduce stress.

**Catie Cuan** is on the cover of [Standford Magazine's May edition](https://stanfordmag.org/latest). Her work with movement and robots was highlighten in their feature article *[Why Dance Matters](https://stanfordmag.org/contents/why-dance-matters?fbclid=IwAR3g9txdbUHURS6rpH3VKYJX3Sz8wfHnve7PFPtm0KI6FA5Mxfhw7LW1EsM)*

**Heather Dewey-Hagborg** was recently interviewed by [DIGICULT](http://digicult.it/articles/the-future-around-the-corner-interview-with-heather-dewey-hagborg/) on how her work explores artificial intelligence and biological surveillance. Heather also  co-curated [*Refiguring The Future*](https://refreshart.tech/#why), a politically engaged exhibition focusing on inclusion, and how the intersection of art, science and technology is an explicitly key force in radical change. This was [REFRESH’s](https://refreshart.tech/#about) inaugural exhibition, which received a Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation grant.

**Moon Ribas** recently had her seismic sensors removed from her feet. After seven years of sensing earthquakes as a cyborg, she's now learning how to adjust to life without seismic activity registering in her physiology. However, Moon has reported to be experiencing phantom movements, confusing her nervous system.

"I’ve started to experience how it feels to lack a cybernetic sense and I’m now feeling phantom earthquakes. How long will these last? Will the extraction of the cybernetic organ affect my identity? Am I a phantom cyborg now? " - Moon Ribas

Moon is curious to see how this transition plays out, while looking forward to experiencing movement through new forms in the future.
