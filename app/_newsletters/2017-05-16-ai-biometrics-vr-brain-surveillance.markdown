title : "Artificial Intelligence, Biometrics, VR and Brain Surveillance"
---

ThoughtWorks Arts is currently seeking an artist/technologist wishing to work on issues surrounding the design, use and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI). AI can enhance the human experience, but can also contribute towards amplifying pre-existing social prejudices and biases, thereby restricting the free flow of individuals, communities and entire populations in untold ways.

View the [open call here](https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2017-implications-of-ai/), and also review [this article from the Directors](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/why-we-are-investigating-biases-artificial-intelligence/) explaining our perspective on this critical issue. Note that we have designed the call to be open-ended, so as to allow artists to surprise us with their proposals. Applications are due by June 8, 2017.
