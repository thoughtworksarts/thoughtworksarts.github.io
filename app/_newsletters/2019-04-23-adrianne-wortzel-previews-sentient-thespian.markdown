title : "Adrianne Wortzel Previews The Sentient Thespian at Pioneer Works"
---
On April 14th, robotics resident Adrianne Wortzel gave a sneak preview of her film [_The Sentient Thespian_](https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/sentient-thespian/) at [Pioneer Works](https://pioneerworks.org/) in Brooklyn.

This humorous and poignant short film explores an irritable and conniving four-legged robot’s intrigues with both a fellow 15-foot industrial robotic arm, and its human interlocutor.<!--excerpt-ends-->Based on elements of Shakespeare’s _“A Midsummer Night’s Dream”_, the film delves into technological transformations and humanity’s quandary on how best to advance towards this new 4th industrial revolution.

The film, shot on location at the [Consortium for Research & Robotics](https://consortiumrr.com/) was hosted by the Pratt Institute in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and features their 16ft tall industrial robotic arm. It also features a spider-like non-humanoid robot called [MekaMon](https://mekamon.com/), manufactured by [Reach Robotics](https://reachrobotics.com/) in the UK.

Director of Photography Kevin Barry says, “_Our aim is to highlight how humans assign sentience to non-sentient machines. Working with robots allows us to explore psychology as it relates to emerging technologies, which really brings home how important it is for humans to see ourselves in the technologies we interact with._”

A full write-up of the project is published [on the Thoughtworks Arts website](https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/sentient-thespian/). And a recent article by TechSPARK highlighting the collaboration with Reach Robotics [can be read here](https://techspark.co/mekamon-takes-the-stage-with-thoughtworks-arts-collaboration/). _The Sentient Thespian_ is the first of a planned trilogy of films by Wortzel featuring MekaMon, to be titled _Golemopolis_.

## Robotics projects presented at Pioneer Works Second Sundays

Resident Catie Cuan also presented the results of her recent robotics and motion residency at Thoughtworks Arts including [CONCAT](https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/concat), part of her larger [OUTPUT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NQQ1c4Z6I0) project.

Catie Cuan is a dancer and roboticist whose practice examines how human-robot communications can be interpreted while progressing towards 21st century robot ubiquity. She is currently enrolled in the PhD program at Stanford University in Mechanical Engineering.

Catie collaborated with Thoughtworks developers to create a 3D visualization toolkit enabling her to rehearse her movements alongside those of different robots.

## Hardware Hack Lab Now Equipped With Depthkit Support

With the success and interest generated during our free [Depthkit](https://www.depthkit.tv/) workshop in conjunction with [Scatter](https://scatter.nyc/) in March, and our funded [Volumetric Filmmaking residency](https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2019-volumetric-residency/) starting in June, we’ve initiated ongoing weekly support for learning and experimenting with Depthkit at the free [Hardware Hack Lab](https://hardwarehacklab.io/). Our aim is to make Depthkit technology and toolkits more accessible, and to help foster diverse collaborations for those who may not have the financial means to otherwise access these innovative and exciting technologies.

These weekly events have attracted hackers and filmmakers of all backgrounds who test ideas and partner on projects.

Hardware Hack Lab is open to the public every Wednesday from 6:30pm - 9:30pm, located at Thoughtworks Inc. 99 Madison Ave, 15th floor, New York, NY.
