During their residency, Max Razdow, Ollie Razdow, and Jamie Zigelbaum will work together developing a generative story-telling project, titled, *All Possible Pathways*.

<!--excerpt-ends-->

The project is a science fiction based narrative concerning A.I.'s future, co-authored and illustrated by Zigelbaum and M. Razdow and input into a decentralized public blockchain ledger. The blockchain based text will then be recomposed by O. Razdow through software coded at Thoughtworks Arts in San Francisco. It will output an audio visual interpretation that changes each time it appears. The artists believe their work both informs and challenges the relationship between AI, its democratization, and its social impacts.

The team will also receive additional support from both [SnarkArt](https://snark.art/) and [SingularityNet](https://singularitynet.io/).

**Max Razdow** is an artist, writer, and teacher living in Boston, MA.  He has taught art practice and theory at New York University, University of Massachusetts and Lesley University, and has shown his drawings and text based works internationally, and co-founded the online art theory journal Speculative Arts Research.

**Ollie Razdow** is a programmer and electronic musician. Starting his journey in the world of music, he moved into programming by implementing sound synthesis programs from scratch. Moving on to a degree in computer science, from Boston University, he is now working on an interpreted language for sound synthesis.

**Jamie Zigelbaum** is an artist, designer, and engineer living in New York and Spain. He was the founding director of Midnight Commercial, a creative studio working across disciplines. In 2010, he received the Designer of the Future award from Design Miami/ Basel. He holds a Masters in Media Arts and Science from the MIT Media Lab.

The residency is scheduled to begin in San Francisco at the end of September, and will conclude at the end of January.  Stay tuned for updates and insights on their developing project.

Rashin's multi-platform, community engaged interactive volumetric work, *A Father’s Lullaby* underscores the role of men in raising children and their absence due to the racial disparities in the criminal justice system with its direct impact on children, women and lower income communities.
On Thu, Sep 26, at 7:00 PM Rashin and the other featured artists will come together for a public conversation at [ICA](https://www.icaboston.org/), on life as visual artists, and to hear about their creative practices. Music and other activities are also planned throughout the evening to celebrate the exhibition.

The event which offers space, emerging tech and support (and dinner!) to the public for free has sparked many interesting collaborations among members over the years. New members are encouraged to bring a project, a toy, an idea, or to simply come in and see what others are doing.

We look forward to including Barcelona's community in this program. Hardware Hack Lab Barcelona will meet at the Thoughtworks offices at Edifici Media-TIC Carrer de Roc Boronat 117, 8ª Planta, 08018 Barcelona, [every other Wednesday at 6:30 PM](https://www.meetup.com/Hardware-Hack-Lab-BCN/)

## Former AI Resident Karen Palmer to Exhibit *Perception iO* at Cooper Hewitt Design Museum in NYC

Artist Karen Palmer (TWA'18) who works in facial recognition and AI will be exhibiting her recent project *Perception iO* at the [Cooper Hewitt Design Museum](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/events/current-exhibitions/upcoming-exhibitions/) in NYC on September 20th.

{% include image file='perception.jpg'
   alt='Perception iO'
%}

*Perception iO* is a facial emotion detection and eye tracking immersive film. Karen teamed up with a dedicated team of programmers at Thoughtworks to develop *Perception iO*, and to integrate the [Tobii Pro](https://www.tobiipro.com/product-listing/nano/) eye gazing hardware into her installation.

The project explores the intersection of AI, neuroscience, behavioral psychology, film, facial emotion detection, eye tracking, bias, and social justice. The immersive storytelling experience reveals how a person’s gaze and emotions influence their perception of reality. Participants are invited  to analyze the data they calibrate in their mind to become aware of their subconscious behavior, implicit bias' and the bias' of AI networks.

*Perception iO* is an evolution of *RIOT*, the project Karen developed during her residency at Thoughtworks.
