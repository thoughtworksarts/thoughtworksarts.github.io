The residencies will take place during 2022 as part of the larger [Leonardo CripTech Incubator](https://leonardo.info/criptech). The program supports artists focusing on disability innovation with artist fellows presenting works-in-progress at Leonardo LASER salons and final works at the Arizona State University California Center in Los Angeles.<!--excerpt-ends--> Their artistic research will also be showcased in a special issue of Leonardo journal published by MIT Press.

Christopher Edwards, a Thoughtworks employee working on CripTech Incubator, says:

> “As a deaf person and experience designer, I know how important it is to engage directly with diversity, with difference. What comes from this program is not just great work that expands the horizons of art and technology, but also that it fosters empathy through collaboration.”

The CripTech program received a $500K sponsorship from the California Arts Council's Innovations + Intersections pilot program to advance groundbreaking strategies for community needs in the wellness and technology sectors. This project will allow  disabled artists to engage and remake creative technologies through the lens of accessibility. Other partners include RadMad Disability Lab (UC Berkeley), Beall Center for Art and Technology (UC Irvine), Santa Barbara Center for Art, Science and Technology, Ground Works with A2rU, Gray Area Foundation for the Arts, and Arizona State University.

## Olivia Ting
Olivia Ting’s fascination with moving images stems from her hearing impairment. She is deaf in one ear and has 22% hearing in the other. Without hearing aids, Olivia perceives almost no sound.

During her residency at Thoughtworks Arts, Olivia will develop “Song Without Words,” a spatial audiovisual investigation of parallels between gestural language, visual vocabulary of American Sign Language, and music conducting.

## Andy Slater
Andy Slater is a sight-impaired Chicago-based media artist, sound designer, teaching artist, and disability advocate. During his residency Andy will develop “Unseen Sound,” an Augmented Reality design tool app to support blind and non-visual users in the creation of spatial audio design.

Each text line is stacked atop each other. White text on a black background resembles a plastic strip from a label maker. The text of the top groups reads, “Max is not accessible” and is repeated over a dozen times. The lower group’s text read, “This shouldn’t be so hard.” This text is repeated over a dozen times. The text lines are staggered to look like a staircase.'

Andy is the founder of the Society of Visually Impaired Sound Artists and director of the Sound As Sight accessible field recording project.  He holds a Masters in Sound Arts and Industries from Northwestern University, and is a teaching artist with the Midwest Society for Acoustic Ecology.
