title : "Dancedemic World Premiere at Battery Dance Festival"
---
[Art-A-Hack’s Special Edition COVID-19 2020 “Dancedemic”](https://artahack.io/projects/) had its world premiere as part of [The 39th Annual Battery Dance Festival](https://batterydance.org/battery-dance-festival/from-battery-dance/).

{% include youtube id='aPwrJDgkJ2M' %}

The live-streamed event was a two-part performance featuring world-renowned dancers from Battery Dance’s immigrant fellowship program, [Hussein Smko](https://batterydance.org/dancers/hussein-smko/) (Iraq/Kurdistan/US) and [Razvan Stoian](https://batterydance.org/dancers/razvan-stoian/) (Romania/US).

<!--excerpt-ends-->

Behind each dance performance was the work of a selected  team of international creative technologists, with members from the US, Brazil, London, Ukraine, Estonia, India - all collaborating remotely.

For six weeks the Art-A-Hack participants explored how live-biometrics and audience input could re-conceptualize choreography and dance production. They used [EmotiBits](https://www.emotibit.com/) to measure the biometrics of the dancers, which triggered interactive visual and sonic environments. Both the augmented performance and raw footage of the dancers in their studios were displayed on [eˉlektron’s](https://elektron.live/) custom-built, multi-channel streaming platform.

## The New York Times Spotlights Robotics Resident Catie Cuan and Art-A-Hack alum Kate Sicchio

A new article by The New York Times, [Dances With Robots, and Other Tales From the Outer Limits](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/05/arts/dance/dance-and-artificial-intelligence.html), highlights work developed at Thoughtworks Arts by former robotics resident Catie Cuan, and also spotlights Art-A-Hack alum Kate Sicchio.

   caption='Catie Cuan with Rethink Robotics Baxter (big robot) and SoftBank Robotics NAO (small robot) in “Time to Compile” Credit: Sam Berube' %}

The article focuses on how Cuan's residency project [Output](/projects/output/) expands the possibilities of dance and our relationship to robots through movement.

> The dancer and choreographer Catie Cuan is the human star of this show, “Output,” which is part of a collaboration with Thoughtworks Arts and the Pratt Institute. And while dancing with robots may sound a bit like science fiction, to Ms. Cuan, who is completing her Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Stanford University, it “feels like an extension of my body — and of possibility.”

> The working assumption for most of history has been that dance is a thing done by and for humans. Yet it does not seem beyond the pale that robots will one day perform for us mortals, particularly when choreographers like Ms. Cuan are using technology to explore the outer limits of the art form. - The New York Times, November 7th, 2020

The article also illustrated how Art-A-Hack alum [Kate Sicchio](https://www.sicchio.com/)'s work “Live Coding Jams” (a visual dance score created by a machine) is an example of how the dance world is navigating performances while lockdown restrictions are in place.

## Presentations

**Andrew McWilliams** and Synthetic Media resident **Nouf Aljowaysir** presented at the virtual [Rethink Italy](http://rethinkfestival.it/) Service Design Festival in June.

{% include youtube id='nC9k6GiQpcc'
   caption='ReThink live-streamed discussion' %}

The live-streamed discussion addressed a Service Design audience with ideas on how art-based technology research informs designers examining a changing social landscape over time. The event showcased cross-collaborative programs by Thoughtworks Arts involving artists and technologists, and how those interactions drive questions about society, and harness technological innovation.

To illustrate the power of this type of research, arts resident Nouf Aljowaysir shared her work investigating the social impacts of artificial intelligence, as well as her work as a creative technologist at Havas, in New York.
