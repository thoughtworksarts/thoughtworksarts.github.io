Ellen will join a group of distinguished scholars, artists, creative technologists, and journalists - all of whom are exploring new forms of storytelling through emerging technologies and sciences.

<!--excerpt-ends-->

While at MIT Open Doc Lab, Ellen will work on [Language Is Leaving Me](http://opendoclab.mit.edu/presents/language-leaving-ellen-pearlman/), an on-going project on the inherited traumatic memory of cultures and diasporas, or epigenetics, through the framework of AI and GANs. She will investigate what can, and cannot be retained and interpreted through digital means.  


## Thoughtworks Arts Presents at Bozar Labs in Conjunction With STARTS Prize 2020

As part of the [Starts Prize 2020 exhibition held at Bozar](https://www.bozar.be/en/activities/168310-starts-prize-20) this Fall, [Bozar Lab](https://www.bozar.be/en/homepages/129187-lab) organized a webinar on the topic of artist and technologist collaborations as a model for innovation.

Artist and A.I. resident, Karen Palmer ([Storyteller From The Future](http://storytellerfromthefuture.com/)), presented her immersive film project [Perception iO](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/karen-palmer-exhibits-perception-cooper-hewitt-design-museum-nyc/), (developed at Thoughtworks Arts) and shared how it explores the intersection of A.I., bias, policing, and new, innovative forms of storytelling.

Perception iO received a [Starts Honorary Mention](https://starts-prize.aec.at/en/perception/) and was included in the exhibition, [Starts Prize ‘20 Speculating On The Future Through Art And Science](https://www.bozar.be/en/activities/168310-starts-prize-20).

Thoughtworks Arts director Andrew McWilliams shared how cross-collaborative programs at Thoughtworks Arts involving artists and technologists create powerful work driven by issues facing technology and society. Andrew detailed how such interactions are a critical tool for harnessing innovation.

## Nouf Aljowaysir and Ellen Pearlman's Work Showcased on AI Art Gallery at NeurIPS4
 
Synthetic Media resident Nouf Aljowaysir and program director Ellen Pearlman both had new work exhibited at [AI Art Gallery](http://www.aiartonline.com/highlights-2020/).

{% include image file='salaf.jpg'

   caption='سلف [Salaf]: StyleGAN2 trained on an empty dataset' %}

The online exhibition showcased works from the annual [NeurIPS4 Creativity Workshop](https://neurips2020creativity.github.io/), a leading machine learning conference for creativity and design, which they both took part in.

Nouf's prototypes from her residency project [سلف [Salaf] (2020)](http://www.aiartonline.com/highlights-2020/nouf-aljowaysir/) were exhibited. سلف [Salaf](2020) is part of an ongoing exploration into constructing her genealogical journey using two different voices: her own and an AI ‘narrator’.

   caption='Sniedze Strauta performing at the AIBO premiere. Her emotions display on her bodysuit of light, akin to an exterior nervous system, and AIBO\'s emotions display as red light (negative). Photo - Taavet Jansen' %}

Ellen's immersive, interactive love story, [AIBO: An Emotionally Intelligent, Artificial Intelligent Brainwave Opera (2020)](http://www.aiartonline.com/art-2020/ellen-pearlman/) was also included in the exhibition. AIBO is about our infatuation and trust in artificial intelligence played out between a human character Eva, and AIBO, a custom built ‘sicko’ AI.

## Deepfakes Masterclass: Thoughtworks Arts and Baltan Labs

Thoughtworks Arts and [Baltan Laboratoratories](https://www.baltanlaboratories.org/) organized the two-week online masterclass: [Deepfakes - Synthetic Media And Synthesis](https://www.baltanlaboratories.org/library/synthetic-media-hackathon) - led by Ellen Pearlman and Thoughtworker Julien Deswaef, and facilitated by Leif Czakai of Baltan Labs.

{% include image file='information-bubbles.png'
   alt='A visualization of ‘information bubbles’'
   caption='Team Two\'s prototype on the visualization of \'information bubbles\' that included examining the at the time online controversial site Parler' %}

Participants were put into three interdisciplinary teams to collaborate on prototyping a synthetic media project. Teams explored the possibilities of artificially generated media and investigated artistic ways in which to apply these innovative findings. Their work was also driven by questions about the societal impacts of this rapidly growing field.

The masterclass concluded in final team presentations of their synthetic media projects, sharing what they learned to develop future projects on a larger scale.
