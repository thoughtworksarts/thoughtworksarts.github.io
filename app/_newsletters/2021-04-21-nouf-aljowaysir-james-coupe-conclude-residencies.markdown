title : "Nouf Aljowaysir and James Coupe Conclude Their Residencies"
---
Thoughtworks Arts' [Simulacra & Similitude: Synthetic Media Residency](/open-call/2020-synthetic-media/) began in the summer of 2020. Due to Covid-19 it was entirely remote with Nouf working from her studio in Brooklyn, New York and James from his studio in Seattle, Washington.

[Nouf Aljowaysir's](/bio/nouf-aljowaysir/) residency developed [Salaf \[Arabic: سلف , ancestor\] (2020)](/projects/salaf/), an ongoing project investigating the cultural transmission of ideas and worldviews across generations.

<!--excerpt-ends-->

She shared her untold Middle Eastern genealogical journey using two different voices: her own and an AI ‘narrator', trained on the constrained datasets from Western models.

The development of her residency project highlighted how Western AI models perpetuate the colonial western gaze and subsequent stereotypes. Using U-2 Net, Nouf erased the ‘oriental’ stereotypical figures in her historical archives, creating an “absent” dataset.

*Salaf* exhibited at [NeurIPS](http://www.aiartonline.com/highlights-2020/nouf-aljowaysir/), the leading machine learning conference for creativity and design. You can learn more about Salaf [Arabic: سلف , ancestor](2020) and how Nouf plans to move forward with its development in our [project write-up](/projects/salaf/).

## James Coupe's Continous Integration (CI) Art Toolkit

Synthetic Media resident [James Coupe](/bio/james-coupe/) recently shared a Continous Integration (CI) art toolkit, now available for free on [Github](https://github.com/anupriyajo/continous-arts). The CL toolkit evolved from a project discovery, which took place online via various cloud-based tools and servers.

The remote workflow opened up new ways for him to organize, store and potentially exhibit his ongoing residency project, Birds of a British Empire - which explores colonial archives and the training sets used in machine learning.

By sharing this CI toolkit, James hopes to enable galleries and exhibition spaces to show new media artworks more easily and lessen hardware and technical expertise demands.

CI offers an alternative solution by relocating most of the hardware and software resources away from the physical gallery and into the Cloud. Cloud-based computers run in dedicated facilities where they are maintained, powered, cooled, backed up, and upgraded by others. This removes the responsibility from the artist and the gallery. When errors occur, or updates are required, the code can be modified remotely without anyone having to be present physically in the gallery.

## Forbes Highlights Catie Cuan's Work With Training Robots Movement

The recent Forbes Magazine article, ["The Arts And Humanities Deliver Untapped Value For The Future"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminwolff/2021/04/06/the-arts-and-humanities-deliver-untapped-value-for-the-future-of-work/?sh=223516823914) spotlighted [Catie Cuan](/bio/catie-cuan/)'s residency at Thoughtworks Arts, where she bridged her work as a choreographer and dancer to train robotic movement.

One of the main takeaways of the article was the need to integrate the humanities into the mechanical engineering industry.

> “As we have robots in more public-facing spaces—offices, hospitals, airports, doctor’s offices—that design space needs to be very deliberate,” said Cuan. “There’s a lot of research that shows the primary attribute of an object that humans react to is how it moves. It’s not color. It’s not what an object sounds like. And you only get a few chances until people are completely alienated by the new thing. So I think either all professional roboticists need to be taking classes in dance and movement generation, or a lot of tech companies are going to be hiring dancers and choreographers to come up with the movement personalities of these robots.” - Catie Cuan

The article also features her new film, "liminal" from her residency project [OUTPUT](/projects/output/). The film beautifully captures parallel, nuanced movements between her and a 15 foot industrial robotic arm, nicknamed Wen.
