title : "Thoughtworks Arts Artists Recognized for Work with BCIs"
---  
Art-A-Hack project Dual Brains by Eva Lee and Aaron Trocola, and Noor: A Brain Opera by Thoughtworks Director Ellen Pearlman were highlighted in a [Redshift article exploring the use of brain-computer interface technology (BCI) in art](https://www.autodesk.com/redshift/brain-computer-interface/).

BCIs enable a communication pathway between a wired brain and an external sensor device. Artists like Lee, Trocola and Pearlman are using this emergent brainwave technology to create new artistic experiences and are currently leading the charge in exploring potential applications of the technology.

## Heather Dewey-Hagborg Premiers New Work

T3511 is a post-genomic love story and experimental documentary 4-channel video installation. It tells the (mostly) true tale of a biohacker who becomes increasingly obsessed with an anonymous donor whose saliva she purchases online.
