This fall the RIXC Art Science Festival, Virtualities and Realities, in Riga, Latvia hosted three members of the Thoughtworks Arts community. RIXC Art Science Festival is an internationally renown gathering for artists and scholars working at the intersection of arts, digital humanities, and science. The Festival includes conferences, exhibitions, performances, and VR artwork showcases.

## Meetup on Ethics of Emerging Storytelling Tech with Karen Palmer

Storytelling is as old as time itself. But with the advent of emerging technologies such as virtual/mixed/augmented reality, and AI storytelling, technology has the power to effect and impact our cognitive and neurological faculties like never before. What's new? What's not? In the age of information and unrest, when facts are under so much scrutiny, at least we know we can trust our feelings. Right...?
