## Ellen Pearlman Presents at U.S. Fulbright Alumni Exchange Seminar
In December, director Ellen Pearlman presented in Santa Fe as a [Fulbright World Learning Specialist](https://fulbrightspecialist.worldlearning.org/the-fulbright-specialist-program/) at [The US Fulbright Alumni Exchange Seminar](https://alumni.state.gov/alumni-news/alumni-thematic-international-exchange-seminars-alumni-ties). The four-day event brought Fulbright alumni whose work speaks to the issue "Art, Culture, and Transforming Conflict".

   caption='Alumni TIES: Art, Culture, Transforming Conflict' %}

Ellen presented “Advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Arts”, highlighting Thoughtworks Arts programs that have promoted social change through their artistic and technology incubations.

The convening also focused on how to address local issues through the development of arts programming and networks of change. The Alumni group collaborated on future community-based projects for which the U.S. State Department will provide grants.

We couldn't have predicted the reach so many of these important collaborations between artists, technologists, and our team would have, nor how developments would play out both publicly and within Thoughtworks. This feedback guides and inspires our vision moving forward.

And now, some highlights from this past year:

## Exhibitions
