In April 2020, Carole compressed her work in video installation to fit beneath her kitchen table, creating an intimate live "venue," and invited Gloria, Scott, Luisa and Jon to [work with Kim’s live visuals](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7960471) in a form of interactive improvisation-based dialogue.

Dilate has embraced the latent nature of telematic performance, developing an artistic practice idiomatic to the venue of networked audio-visual art.

## Thoughtworks Arts at Ars Electronica Festival '21: Co-Creation Containers

[Ars Electronica's A New Digital Deal 2021 Festival](https://ars.electronica.art/newdigitaldeal/en/theme/) brought together Thoughtworks Arts director Ellen Pearlman, [CounterPulse](https://www.counterpulse.org/) director Julie Phelps, and [Zero1](https://zero1.org/) director Shamsher Virk for [Co-Creation Containers](https://ars.electronica.art/newdigitaldeal/en/co-creation-containers/) - a dynamic round-table discussion on building community by digital infrastructure.

{% include image file='ars-electronica-1.jpg'
   class='no-border' %}

Ars Electronica is the largest and most time-honored new media arts festival in the world, going back more than thirty years. It was designed to take the Digital Revolution’s emergence as an opportunity to examine potential futures and to focus investigations at the intersection of art, technology, and society.

{% include image file='ars-electronica-2.jpg' %}

*Co-creation Containers* took place on Thursday, September 9th as part of the festival’s online programming focused on digital humanity. Pearlman, Phelps, and Virk discussed how the climate crisis, international pandemic, and political polarization have challenged the limits of place, mobility, and infrastructure. All three panelists presented projects that show ways in which we can continue to create when borders are closed. 

The discussion progressed into sharing ideas on how we can build creative connections across distance and difference, via creative, collaborative, and innovative platforms. Questions and insights from the public via a live discussion and question link provided framing for what the next chapter in the digital community may look like, with deep diving questions about who all will have access.

*Video of the Co-creation Containers panel event will be available soon.*
