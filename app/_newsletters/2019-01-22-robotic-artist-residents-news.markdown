title          : "Robotic Artist Residents in the News"
---
Robotics resident Catie Cuan was recently featured in a video feature for [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/12/robot-choreography-catie-cuan/), highlighting the importance of machine movement.

In the interview, Catie explains her ideas on how robotics are impacting society and how choreography can change the way we understand human-robot interactions.

Catie was also recently featured on a [PBS NewsHour segment on the future of work](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/concat-tool-feature-pbs/). The segment shows how Catie is applying her project work created with Thoughtworks Arts to her doctoral research in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University.

The software featured in the video, [CONCAT](https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/concat), was created by developers at Thoughtworks over the fall. The technology enables Catie to rehearse her own bodily movements alongside those of industrial-scale robots.

Adrianne Wortzel, also a resident at Thoughtworks Arts over the summer of 2018, is completing a film based on her explorations in robotics. The film, titled ROBOTA PERSONAE, will explore how “sentient” robots interact with non-sentient robots. Not a word is spoken in a choreographed dance, and yet movements and mime promote a totally visceral experience of comedy, tragedy, delight and horror. More updates coming in our next newsletter.

## Thoughtworks Arts interview in CLOT Magazine

Curator and researcher Ashley Lee Wong [interviewed Thoughtworks Arts directors Andrew McWilliams and Ellen Pearlman for CLOT Magazine](http://www.clotmag.com/thoughtworks-arts-residency-leveraging-corporate-resources-for-art-social-change-by-ashley-lee-wong) about their ambitious arts residency to engage with socially relevant projects using emerging technologies.
