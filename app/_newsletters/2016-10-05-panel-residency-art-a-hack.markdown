## Meet Our Artist Residents

We’re excited to have Heather Dewey-Hagborg [join us](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/introducing-heather-dewey-hagborg/) as Thoughtworks’ newest artist resident. Heather is an artist and researcher known for her work highlighting the implications of DNA as data.

During her time at Thoughtworks, Heather intends to begin a new body of work, currently named Sell/Bio, in which she will research the “histories, infrastructures, protocols and business models” that position DNA as a “commodity to be bought and sold on the open market.”
