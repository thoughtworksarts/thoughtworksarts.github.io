During her ThoughtWorks Arts Residency, with support from [Scatter](http://scatter.nyc/), Rashin will be using [Depthkit](https://www.depthkit.tv/) to expand her practice, furthering the development of her project, _A Father's Lullaby_.

<!--excerpt-ends-->

_A Father’s Lullaby_ is a multi-platform, community engaged interactive work that highlights the role of men in raising children and their absence due to the racial disparities in the criminal justice system. The project is a “Poetic Cyber Movement for Social Justice,” where art and technology mobilizes a plethora of voices to ignite a more inclusive dialogue to effect social change.

Rashin is currently a research fellow at MIT Open Documentary Lab and a visiting faculty at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. She will be in residence at ThoughtWorks Arts from June 10 to September 27, 2019, and her project is slated to be shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in Boston, MA.

You can learn more about Rashin, her project, and our residency partner Scatter, in the [announcement blog post](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/rashin-fahandej-awarded-volumtric-filmmaking-residency/).


## Extension of The Open Call for The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence

ThoughtWorks Arts has extended the open call [The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence via Blockchain](https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2019-democratization-ai-blockchain/) until July 31, 2019.

Artists are invited to investigate the monopolization and centralization of artificial intelligence by a small number of corporate giants and state actors.

We are leaving it open to artists to surprise us with proposals that address the many and varied themes around the ownership of AI, using the tension between monopolization and democratization as a point of departure.

One alternative option to concentrated control is decentralized community ownership of AI using blockchain technology. To support this residency, we partnered with [Snark.art](https://snark.art/), a blockchain technology company empowering artists to move the medium.

For this fully funded, 16 week residency, we are looking for creatives to develop innovative approaches including, but not limited to, emerging relationships between AI, blockchain, open source and global control that will result in a unique artwork.
