## Art-A-Hack projects from CYBERFEST 2018 in St. Petersburg

For the first time ever, Art-A-Hack™ was in St. Petersburg, Russia for [CYFEST 2018](http://cyland.org/lab/cyland-projects/cyfest11/), produced in collaboration with [CYLAND MediaArtLab](http://cyland.org/lab/). Artists, programmers and creative practitioners [teamed up to develop their ideas over two consecutive weekends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOADin8YRoc) before presenting final projects in a public opening at the Berthold Centre in St. Petersburg on February 10th.

Projects from this Art-A-Hack included _Digital Hologram_, a projected, animated hologram that responds to a typed question asked to a Google AI API; _Word Cloud_, that produced sonic and visual elements relating to questions asked to the ‘emotional’ response of IBM’s Watson API;  and _Blinking_, which used Open CV to detect nuances in an observer’s blinking to edit a movie. _Hologram_ will be shown at Tate Modern’s Tate Exchange special program, March 6 - 11, 2018.

## OPEN CALL: Thoughtworks Arts Summer ‘18 Residency in Robotics

Applications are now being accepted for our next Thoughtworks Arts residency for Summer 2018: Mechanics and Movement.  We are looking for artists who are actively exploring these realms to produce surprising twists and turns in the non-verbal dance between code, gears, blood, flesh and inspiration. Although language is an important aspect to this field, we are more interested in non-verbal cues and responses. Please help spread the word and share the [Open Call](https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2018-mechanical-movement/). Deadline for applications is March, 26th, 2018.    

## Cyborg Foundation launches the Transpecies Society

Past residents and Co-Founders of the Cyborg Foundation, Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas, have launched a social project called the [Transpecies Society](https://www.transpeciessociety.com/about), a membership-based organization for people who identify as or would like to transition to non-human identities.

{% include image file='neil-moon.jpg'
   caption='Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas working at Thoughtworks in NYC' %}

The Transpecies Society is an association that gives voice to non-human identities, raises awareness of the challenges transpecies face, advocates for the freedom of self-design, and offers the development of new senses and organs.
