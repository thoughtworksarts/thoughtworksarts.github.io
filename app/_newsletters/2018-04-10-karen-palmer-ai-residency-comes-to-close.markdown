Karen Palmer, filmmaker and “storyteller from the future” has spent the last 6 months at Thoughtworks as our Artist in Residence, focused on AI for her emotionally responsive immersive film, RIOT.

During the residency, Thoughtworks developers have written and open-sourced an emotional expression analysis system named [EmoPy](https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/EmoPy), building on the work Karen did with AI researcher [Dr. Hongying Meng](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~eesthhm/) of Brunel University in London.

The system is performing well under test, and is usable by anyone for a variety of purposes. It is also fully integrated as an improved emotion detection system at the core of the new version of Karen’s RIOT installation.

Leading the technical development effort is ThoughtWorker [Angelica Perez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelica-perez-56a501100/), a graduate from Stanford specializing in artificial intelligence research. RIOT is Angelica’s first project since joining Thoughtworks in July 2017.

During the last six months, Karen has also completed a TED Residency, and exhibited her work at the Future of Storytelling festival on Staten Island. Her work and her residency at Thoughtworks have been featured in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katmustatea/2017/12/30/this-filmmaker-from-the-future-can-teach-you-to-channel-your-fear/), [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/40498786/when-your-fear-is-the-remote-control), and [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/13/riot-2-interactive-film-karen-palmer-interview/). Thoughtworks team member Stephanie Weber was inspired by the project to write an article exploring [how artificial intelligence is transforming the criminal justice system](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/artificial-intelligence-criminal-justice-system/).  

## Thoughtworks Arts at SPRING/BREAK Art Show

Thoughtworks Arts in collaboration with HarvestWorks, exhibited at the SPRING/BREAK Art Show during New York's Armory Week in March 2018\. Artists from the Thoughtworks Arts Residency, Art-A-Hack, and our Directors were all included in this critically acclaimed, curator driven alternate art fair at 4 Times Square. We were honored to be selected to show in the highly competitive Special Projects section.
