title : "New Robotics, AI, and Climate Change projects at ThoughtWorks Arts"
listing-teaser : Our Art-A-Hack Special Edition has produced projects ranging from emotionally-intelligent AI through climate change.
---
This summer we were thrilled to host a Special Edition Art-A-Hack in collaboration with [The Volumetric Society](http://www.meetup.com/volumetric/), the [Human Impacts Institute](https://www.humanimpactsinstitute.org/) and the [New York City College of Technology (City Tech)](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/).

Four teams met over four Saturdays to create projects around two parallel issues.

<!--excerpt-ends-->

*   Climate Change: Data & Disinformation
*   Emotionally Intelligent Artificial Intelligence & Brain-Computer Interfaces

Following the hacking sessions, each team presented their project and initial prototypes in a final showcase at ThoughtWorks NYC.

Exploring climate change issues were the teams _Climate Consciousness_ and _Another World_. On the emotionally intelligent AI & BCI track we had _The Accessible Brain_ team and _Sentimental Feeling / Second Skin_. Stay tuned for project write-ups and videos this fall!

## Updates from our Robotics Residency

Artist Adrianne Wortzel has been [exploring the movements and in-built motion of Reach Robotics' MekaMon robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQgA8xYZVc) as part of her ThoughtWorks Arts Residency. The MekaMon is a multi-functional, connected, battle bot with augmented reality capabilities. She also recently gave a talk about her work with the MekaMon, which runs on Swift, at the [Brooklyn Swift Meetup](https://vimeo.com/bklnswift/review/278044295/b8cbf2d8e7).

Resident Catie Cuan spoke at the symposium 'Humanities Innovators in a Tech World,' hosted by the University of Arizona College of Humanities. Tune in at 1:17:00 to hear her [discuss her robotics work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&v=kL-CY9YWy9Y). Recently, she performed an excerpt of her work _Time to Compile_ featuring two human performers and the NAO robot at the [Dance NOW Festival at Joe's Pub](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/arts/dance/dance-in-nyc-this-week.html). Catie will be performing again in Brooklyn for the [10th Annual Collaborat­ions in Dance Festival](https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/41/35/24-dancing-with-robots-greenpoint-2018-08-31-bk.html) at Triseklion Arts on Friday, September 14th.

Both residents worked with [Consortium for Research and Robotics](http://consortiumrr.com/), where they had the opportunity to explore different projects relating to the ABB IRB 6700 industrial robot arm. Check out our blog post for more detail on their [work with industrial robotics and human interaction](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/movement-industrial-robotic-arm/) at CRR.  

## How to Make a Neural Net

[In this short video](https://vimeo.com/275748144) ThoughtWorks engineer Angelica Perez discusses how to create a data set for AI. Angelica worked as the lead developer with Karen Palmer on her immersive film, RIOT. Angelica overviews how they developed a neural network to predict emotion through facial expression for the emotionally responsive artificial intelligence behind the film.

Angelica also recently published two posts on her work with Karen: the first, an [introduction to the field of Facial Expression Recognition (FER)](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/recognizing-facial-expressions-machine-learning/), and the second [describing the design and uses of EmoPy](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/emopy-emotional-expression-toolkit/), the FER toolkit developed RIOT.
