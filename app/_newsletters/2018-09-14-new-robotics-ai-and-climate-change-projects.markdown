title : "New Robotics, AI, and Climate Change projects at Thoughtworks Arts"
---
This summer we were thrilled to host a Special Edition Art-A-Hack in collaboration with [The Volumetric Society](http://www.meetup.com/volumetric/), the [Human Impacts Institute](https://www.humanimpactsinstitute.org/) and the [New York City College of Technology (City Tech)](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/).

Four teams met over four Saturdays to create projects around two parallel issues.

<!--excerpt-ends-->

*   Climate Change: Data & Disinformation
*   Emotionally Intelligent Artificial Intelligence & Brain-Computer Interfaces

Following the hacking sessions, each team presented their project and initial prototypes in a final showcase at Thoughtworks NYC.

Exploring climate change issues were the teams _Climate Consciousness_ and _Another World_. On the emotionally intelligent AI & BCI track we had _The Accessible Brain_ team and _Sentimental Feeling / Second Skin_. Stay tuned for project write-ups and videos this fall!

## Updates from our Robotics Residency

Artist Adrianne Wortzel has been [exploring the movements and in-built motion of Reach Robotics' MekaMon robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQgA8xYZVc) as part of her Thoughtworks Arts Residency. The MekaMon is a multi-functional, connected, battle bot with augmented reality capabilities. She also recently gave a talk about her work with the MekaMon, which runs on Swift, at the [Brooklyn Swift Meetup](https://vimeo.com/bklnswift/review/278044295/b8cbf2d8e7).

Resident Catie Cuan spoke at the symposium 'Humanities Innovators in a Tech World,' hosted by the University of Arizona College of Humanities. Tune in at 1:17:00 to hear her [discuss her robotics work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&v=kL-CY9YWy9Y). Recently, she performed an excerpt of her work _Time to Compile_ featuring two human performers and the NAO robot at the [Dance NOW Festival at Joe's Pub](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/arts/dance/dance-in-nyc-this-week.html). Catie will be performing again in Brooklyn for the [10th Annual Collaborations in Dance Festival](https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/41/35/24-dancing-with-robots-greenpoint-2018-08-31-bk.html) at Triseklion Arts on Friday, September 14th.

Both residents worked with [Consortium for Research and Robotics](http://consortiumrr.com/), where they had the opportunity to explore different projects relating to the ABB IRB 6700 industrial robot arm. Check out our blog post for more detail on their [work with industrial robotics and human interaction](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/movement-industrial-robotic-arm/) at CRR.  

## How to Make a Neural Net

[In this short video](https://vimeo.com/275748144) Thoughtworks engineer Angelica Perez discusses how to create a data set for AI. Angelica worked as the lead developer with Karen Palmer on her immersive film, RIOT. Angelica overviews how they developed a neural network to predict emotion through facial expression for the emotionally responsive artificial intelligence behind the film.

Angelica also recently published two posts on her work with Karen: the first, an [introduction to the field of Facial Expression Recognition (FER)](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/recognizing-facial-expressions-machine-learning/), and the second [describing the design and uses of EmoPy](https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/emopy-emotional-expression-toolkit/), the FER toolkit developed RIOT.

She is also hosting a [weekend workshop on Immersive Storytelling for the Global Good](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/immersive-storytelling-for-the-global-good-tickets-49339828756​) October 13th and 14th in NYC.  

Media artist and filmmaker Annie Berman is working on two new films: _The Faithful_, a feature length essay film exploring the legacy of Elvis Presley, Pope John Paul II, and Princess Diana, and _Berlin: Underneath_, a VR film using 360 degree video technology to create an immersive viewing experience of Berlin, Germany. She recently screened her film _Street Views_ for the Brooklyn Filmmakers Collective and her new work, _East/West_ is currently on view at Flux Factory as part of the [S.T.E.P.](http://www.fluxfactory.org/event/step/) show in Long Island City.  

Aaron Trocoloa will present a creative showcase of modern aesthetics, digital fabrication, and wearable electronics, showing jewelry, accessories and fashion-tech in FUTURE FASHION at [World Maker Faire NYC](https://makerfaire.com/new-york/) on September 22nd at 5pm.  

**Dr. Kate Sicchio** started as an Assistant Professor at Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts, where she will be teaching an interdisciplinary live coding class this fall.  

Artist and programmer Gene Kogan taught a workshop this summer on [Machine Learning For Creative Media](http://www.scm.cityu.edu.hk/event/176) at the City University of Hong Kong School of Creative Media.  

In August **Gal Nissim** with support by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (LMCC) and the Culture & Animals Foundation presented _The Synanthrope Preserve: The Washing Bear,_ a 35-minute audio experience that guided listeners through Central Park at night to discover both natural and manmade features often overlooked or invisible during the day.
