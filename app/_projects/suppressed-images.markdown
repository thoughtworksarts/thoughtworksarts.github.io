While incarcerated in military prison, Chelsea sent cheek swabs to Heather, who sampled the DNA and [produced 3D-printed masks](http://deweyhagborg.com/projects/radical-love) as portraits. The masks gave Chelsea a form of public visibility, at a time when no other images of her could be taken or shared.

*Suppressed Images* documents this collaboration, illustrating Heather's technique for converting DNA samples into physical portraits. The story goes on to explore nuances and risks associated with use of the technology.

The graphic story was written by Chelsea Manning and Heather Dewey-Hagborg, and illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, a designer with Thoughtworks India. It's hand-drawn ink presentation and comic style opened up the story to new audiences. The story was published at [suppressedimages.net](https://suppressedimages.net) in the final week of Barack Obama's presidency.

The final pane of the story includes a speculative twist in which Chelsea's sentence is commuted and, now free, is able to attend a showing of Heather's work. This twist spectacularly came true shortly after the story's publication, and the show took place [at Fridman Gallery in New York](https://www.fridmangallery.com/a-becoming-resemblance), opening August 2017.
