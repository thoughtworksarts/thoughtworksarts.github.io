*Biofields* is an open-source framework combining biosensors with volumetric and interval arithmetic simulations to interactively model the feeling of energy around the body.

Aided by Lewey Geselowitz on body simulation and rendering, the project draws from traditional circulatory anatomy, eastern medicine, simulation techniques and biosensor innovations.

The idea is to support overlapping fields of thermal, photonic, heart-rate, EM frequencies, and various colors to combine and interpolate multiple single-point biosensors into spatial-fields of real-time imagery in VR.

This piece is currently a work-in-progress.
