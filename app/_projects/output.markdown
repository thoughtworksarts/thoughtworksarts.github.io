Catie Cuan's _OUTPUT_ illuminates how bodies, both human and robotic, are mediated and represented through technology. It centers around a live performance which creates relationships between vestiges of real (human) and captured (technological) bodies.

_OUTPUT_ premiered at Triskelion Arts’ Collaborations in Dance Festival in Brooklyn on September 14, 2018. This performance piece was aided by the development of two new software tools, _CONCAT_ and _MOSAIC_.

The _CONCAT_ system [visualizes a realtime 3D animation](https://github.com/thoughtworksarts/concat) of a 15 foot industrial robot arm, nicknamed _Wen_, moving alongside a live motion capture of a person. This shows the comparison and contrast of a human body next to an automated robot body, akin to a video game matching a live body to its mechanical shadow.

The _MOSAIC_ software used a webcam to generate time-delayed video segments, stacked side by side. The two softwares allow space for improvisation during live performance, creating a link between the human form and the robotic arm.

To create this performance, Catie collaborated with ThoughtWorks developers and the [Consortium for Research and Robotics](https://consortiumrr.com/), a research center of Pratt Institute in New York.

OUTPUT was featured on [PBS NewsHour](/blog/concat-tool-feature-pbs/) in a segment on the future of work, and in an [Engadget video feature and article on robotic choreography](https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/12/robot-choreography-catie-cuan/).

The project was also demonstrated at the TED Education Weekend in October, 2018, and at Pioneer Works Second Sunday in April, 2019, and at the Dance USA Conference in June, 2019.

An academic paper describing the work and its implications [was published](http://aisb2019.machinemovementlab.net/MTSB2019_Cuan_Pearlman_McWilliams.pdf) in the _Movement that Shapes Behaviour_ symposium at the 2019 Artificial Intelligence and Simulation Behaviour Convention, titled _“OUTPUT: Translating Robot and Human Movers Across Platforms in a Sequentially Improvised Performance”_.
