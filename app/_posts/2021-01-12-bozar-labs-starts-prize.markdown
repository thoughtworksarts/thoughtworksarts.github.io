Perception IO, which was developed at Thoughtworks Arts, received a [Starts Honorary Mention](https://starts-prize.aec.at/en/perception/) and was included in the exhibition, [Starts Prize '20 Speculating On The Future Through Art And Science](https://www.bozar.be/en/activities/168310-starts-prize-20).

Thoughtworks Arts Director Andrew McWilliams shared how cross-collaborative programs at Thoughtworks Arts involving artists and technologists create powerful work driven by issues facing technology and society. Andrew detailed how such interactions are a critical tool for harnessing innovation.

The webinar, which took place on Saturday 28th November, also brought together Paul Dujardin (BOZAR), Ruth Reichstein (EU Commission), Christophe De Jaeger (BOZAR LAB), Emma Dumartheray (BOZAR LAB), Stefan Grosjean (Smappee & Snowball), Alexandra Vanhuyse (Snowball), Piet Haerens (HAEDES), and Jonathan Berte (Robovision). 

The participants of the webinar also reflected on the historical Bauhaus movement and how it encouraged interdisciplinary collaborations between artists, scientists, engineers, architects, etc. This generated ideas around how to sustain innovation - concluding that consistent collaboration is key.
