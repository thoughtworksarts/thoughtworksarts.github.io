Rashin's multi-platform, community engaged interactive volumetric work, *A Father’s Lullaby* underscores the role of men in raising children and their absence due to the racial disparities in the criminal justice system with its direct impact on children, women and lower income communities.

With support from our residency partner [Scatter](http://scatter.nyc/), Rashin Fahandej has incorporated volumetric filmmaking into her practice, using Depthkit technology. Volumetric filmmaking has allowed her to expand and enhance the possibilities for her immersive visual poetry.
