The talk centers on example projects which help to illustrate the mission of ThoughtWorks Arts, and its role in incubating research projects into emerging technologies, driven specifically by artistic inquiry.

Projects discussed included [RIOT](/projects/riot/), an emotionally-driven film by artist Karen Palmer, and [Suppressed Images](/projects/suppressed-images/), a project which explores genetic data and its misuse. The talk also looks in detail at the [work of cyborg artist Neil Harbisson](/projects/time-sense/), one of ThoughtWorks Arts initial residency projects. This project exemplifies the idea of artistic inquiry exposing new worldviews on emerging tech.
