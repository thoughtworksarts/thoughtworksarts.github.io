Having completed our first round of hacking, our teams walked us through their journeys at the awesome new events space <a href="http://new.livestream.com/">Livestream Public</a> in Bushwick.

Each team presented on-stage and showed us some of their outcomes and demos. Thanks to Livestream we have archived video of the whole show.

We've had some great experiences, exciting insights, and helped create connections between talented people. Finally, we've topped it off with an engaging showcase.

Here is the photographic evidence of the night:

A fantastic evening and looking forward to doing it all again for season 2!
