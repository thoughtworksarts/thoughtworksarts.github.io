Our 2015 season kicked off last Friday with a social mixer at the Metropolitan Museum's Media Lab.

Art-A-Hackers met and discussed their projects and got to know each other in advance of the co-working sessions ahead.

Media Lab director Don Undeen was on hand to talk about the Museum's facilities, which the Art-A-Hackers will have access to in the coming weeks. The Art-A-Hackers get to and discover who each other are, the interests they have, and what skills they would like to bring to their collaborations.

Going forward teams will be spending full-day sessions working alongside each other, but the social at the Met's Media Lab is a great chance to relax and get to know each other.
