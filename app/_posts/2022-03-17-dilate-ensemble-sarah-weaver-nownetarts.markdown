The conversation focused on Dilate Ensemble's unique explorations pushing the boundaries of telematic networks resulting in their CATENA performance in January.

CATENA, a non-looping visual and densely textured sound experience had performers and audience members explore livestreams from two different physical spaces inside CounterPulse’s Tenderloin San Francisco building. Seamlessly integrated remote, distributed, and off-site sound and movement performances were mixed into the live time environment. CATENA interrogated what the imprint of a physical space and the bodies within can be given the harsh restrictions imposed during Covid lockdown.

Dilate Ensemble includes:

* Carole Kim (SoCal): video installation, direction
* Gloria Damijan (Vienna): extended toy pianos, percussion
* Scott L. Miller (Minnesota): Kyma, electronics
* Luisa Muhr (New York): voice
* Jon Raskin (NoCal): sax, concertina, electronics, recycled materials
* With special guest: Shinichi Iova-Koga: dance
