The conversation focused on Dilate Ensemble's unique explorations pushing the boundaries of telematic networks resulting in their CATENA performance in January.

CATENA, a non-looping visual and densely textured sound experience had performers and audience members explore livestreams from two different physical spaces inside CounterPulseâ€™s Tenderloin San Francisco building. Seamlessly integrated remote, distributed, and off-site sound and movement performances were mixed into the live time environment. CATENA interrogated what the imprint of a physical space and the bodies within can be given the harsh restrictions imposed during Covid lockdown.

Dilate Ensemble includes:

* Carole Kim (SoCal): video installation, direction
* Gloria Damijan (Vienna): extended toy pianos, percussion
* Scott L. Miller (Minnesota): Kyma, electronics
* Luisa Muhr (New York): voice
* Jon Raskin (NoCal): sax, concertina, electronics, recycled materials
* With special guest: Shinichi Iova-Koga: dance
