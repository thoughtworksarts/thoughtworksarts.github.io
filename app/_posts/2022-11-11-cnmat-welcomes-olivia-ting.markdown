CNMAT is dedicated to multidisciplinary research and the creative use of sound - bringing innovation to new and tradional sound and performance spaces.

Olivia Ting creates audio-visual spatial videos that weave sound and scene fragments, representing how she experiences the world around her. Olivia’s fascination with moving image stems from her hearing impairment — she is deaf in one ear and has 22% hearing in the other. Olivia uses her music training to examine how her brain re-learns to hear again, an amalgamation of memory and digital algorithms.

During her CripTech residency at Thoughtworks Arts, Olivia is exploring the parallels between spatiality and movement, sign language, film, gesture, haptic intimacy and orchestral conducting. Her project focuses on tensions between sound, vision, meaning and interpretation situated through her life long experience in environments of disruptive hearing. This new work will result in a mixed media, multi-model installation in 2023.

While in residence at CNMAT she will continue developing sound design and spatial/haptic translations of her audiovisual installation work, with UC Berkeley professors Edmund Campion and Luke Dzwobczyk.

CNMAT supports a dynamic group of educational, performance and research programs focused on the creative interaction between new music and emerging technologies. CNMAT partners with the Department of Music and further collaborates with a number of affiliate departments, presenters, centers, and units on campus, including the Department of Art Practice, the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, the Department of Film and Media, the Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation, the College of Environmental Design, the Arts Research Center, the Townsend Center for the Humanities, the Berkeley Institute of Design, the Berkeley Center for New Media, BAM/PFA, Cal Performances, and the Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life.
