Ellen presented "Advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Arts", highlighting Thoughtworks Arts based programs that have promoted social change through their artistic and technology incubations.

In 2017 Ellen Pearlman received a Fulbright World Learning Specialist Grant. The Fulbright World Learning program connects exceptionally qualified U.S. academics and professionals with institutions abroad to develop programs and share their knowledge.

With this grant, Ellen was able to collaborate with Liepaja University in Liepaja, Latvia and RISEBA University in Riga, Latvia using [Art-A-Hack](https://artahack.io/) and its intensive art and technology methods. Now, as part of the expansive network of [Fulbright Alumni TIES](https://alumni.state.gov/alumni-news/alumni-thematic-international-exchange-seminars-alumni-ties), Ellen will continue to take part in World Learning's exchange seminars implementing initiatives both locally and globally.
