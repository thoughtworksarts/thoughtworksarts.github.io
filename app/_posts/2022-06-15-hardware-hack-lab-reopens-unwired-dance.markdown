The [Unwired Dance Theatre](https://www.unwireddancetheatre.com/) makes immersive and playable experiences for remote and in-person audiences, virtual stages, galleries and unconventional sites.

Using networked wearables to XR, Clémence and collaborators work at the intersection of dance and technology. They question our sense of empathy, connection and remoteness, particularly when mediated through technology.

The Hardware Hack Lab reduced operations in 2020 in response to the spread of the COVID-19 in the United States. The lab's reopening special was an emotional return for many longtime members and a moment of discovery for new attendees.

In the coming months, other special in-person lab events will be planned, setting the stage for a return to regular hack lab events in the future.
