To comply with ongoing COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, these residencies will occur both online and in person at the two residency sites as appropriate.

## h0t club
_h0t club_ is a [psychedelic consumer-driven company](/bio/h0t-club/) of artist technologists and music makers performing the internet and beyond. The collective features Kate Bergstrom, Martim Galvão, Alex Dupuis, Todd Anderson, Miller Puckette and Bryan Jacobs.

[Kate Bergstrom](/bio/kate-bergstrom/), [Martim Galvão](/bio/martim-s-galvao/) and [Miller Puckette](/bio/miller-puckette/) will work with developers at Thoughtworks and the community of CounterPulse in San Francisco to develop and extend their performance work exploring entanglements with surveillance, systems infrastructures and the web.

Building bespoke performance systems and open source technologies with a mixture of vapor wave and agit prop aesthetics, _h0t club_ compresses and compiles, through coding and new software platforms, guitar solos, Mozilla hubs, tubas of toothpaste, valerie bots and more in the original 3-D TECHNOLOGY, live performances and networks of Muzak-al culture jamming combatting dehumanization and corporate hegemony.

## Dilate Ensemble
Dilate Ensemble is an [audio-visual collective](https://www.dilateensemble.com/) featuring multimedia installation artist [Carole Kim](/bio/carole-kim/) and musicians [Gloria Damijan](/bio/gloria-damijan/), [Scott L. Miller](/bio/scott-miller/), [Luisa Muhr](/bio/luisa-muhr/) and [Jon Raskin](/bio/jon-raskin/).

In April 2020, Carole compressed her work in video installation to fit beneath her kitchen table, creating an intimate live "venue," and invited Gloria, Scott, Luisa and Jon to [work with Kim’s live visuals](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7960471) in a form of interactive improvisation-based dialogue.

Work is collaboratively developed, involving a shared visual element delivered over Zoom. Netty-McNetface is used to mix the audio in Scott's studio, where he processes the audio tracks in Kyma—monitored by the ensemble in Netty—and OBS to produce a live a-v work that is streamed.

Dilate has embraced the latent nature of telematic performance, developing an artistic practice idiomatic to the venue of networked audio-visual art.
