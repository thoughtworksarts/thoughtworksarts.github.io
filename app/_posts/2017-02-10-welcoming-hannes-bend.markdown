hannes practice centers around merging the insights from creative and contemplative practices, technology and science. He has presented, published, researched and exhibited projects internationally at museums, conferences and institutions, and guided breathing, yoga and meditation sessions globally.

During his residency at ThoughtWorks, hannes intends to extend the range of biosensors which can be used in the VR environment, and to develop the user experience of the program towards an aim of increasing personal awareness and mindfulness.

We are looking forward to working with hannes on the realization of this exciting project.
