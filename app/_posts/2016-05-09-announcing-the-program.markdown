title     : "Announcing the Thoughtworks Arts Residency"
---
Thoughtworks is excited to announce the launch of our arts residency program. Based out of our New York offices, the residency offers artists access to our facilities, equipment and staff for a period of sixteen weeks.

During this period, artists will be working with the global team of ThoughtWorkers including developers, designers, analysts, data scientists, project managers and various subject matter experts to further their research and development of their projects and artistic pursuits.

Our aim for this program is to create a space where leading technology artists and Thoughtworks employees can work together to explore emerging technologies.

The residency is inspired by some of Thoughtworks [core values](https://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us). Working with artists who are at the forefront of the creative technology field augments our ability to champion software excellence and provides an opportunity to think critically about its potential and use for social change.

The residency compliments our existing public programming from Thoughtworks New York including the weekly meetup [Hardware Hack Lab](https://hardwarehacklab.io/) and the annual co-creation experiment [Art-A-Hack](https://artahack.io/).

We are excited to share the learnings, outcomes and further the use of creative technology with artists and technologists on this blog, please stay tuned for progress and updates.
