## About h0t club

During h0t club's 16-week residency at Thoughtworks Arts and CounterPulse the artists developed performing robots who respond to sensors and cameras placed throughout CounterPulse’s project space moving autonomously and communicating with one another via a wireless network. This hybrid virtual/physical network of human and non-human agents is influenced and guided by the emergent behaviors of the system’s inhabitants.

This showcase is an extension of their previous work:
