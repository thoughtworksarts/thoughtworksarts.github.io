Exploring Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), as well as data and networks, we aim to connect a diverse group of global practitioners to create collaborative artwork that will amplify voices and responses to the climate emergency.

With the support of the [U.S. Embassy in Singapore](https://sg.usembassy.gov/), the [Swiss Arts Council Pro Helvetia](https://prohelvetia.ch/en/) (New Delhi), [Goethe-Institut / Max Muller Bhavan](https://www.goethe.de/de/index.html) (Bangalore), and from us here at Thoughtworks Arts, and in partnership with [Supernormal](https://www.arts.com.my/check-it-out/supernormal-art-gallery) (Singapore), [In The Wild](https://www.weareinthewild.com/) (Singapore) and [Dara.network](https://www.dara.network/) (USA), Art-A-Hack 2021 *Special Edition* will organize across multiple hubs, and will function like an ‘online makers festival’.

This is an opportunity for participants to gain free training in climate, AI/ML and tech during the month of August, and to meet an international group of like-minded people to discuss how to cultivate impactful, collaborative work, across borders. Participants who are interested will also have the opportunity to form teams during the month of September to develop prototypes and artworks, with the support of experienced mentors.
