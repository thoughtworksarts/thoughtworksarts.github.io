*Perception iO* is a facial emotion detection and eye tracking immersive film. Over the summer Karen teamed up with a dedicated team of programmers at Thoughtworks to develop *Perception iO*, and to integrate the [Tobii Pro](https://www.tobiipro.com/product-listing/nano/) eye gazing hardware into her installation.

The project explores the intersection of AI, neuroscience, behavioral psychology, film, facial emotion detection, eye tracking, bias, and social justice.

The immersive storytelling experience reveals how a personâ€™s gaze and emotions influence their perception of reality. Participants are invited to analyze the data they calibrate in their mind to become aware of their subconscious behavior, implicit bias and the bias of AI networks.

_Perception iO_ is an evolution of [RIOT](https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/riot/), a project Karen developed during her residency at Thoughtworks.
